“Stop spreading the lies about me, I’ve never dated Minnie,” said controversial businessman Edwin Sodi after rumours this week that he was having an affair with the media personality. On Wednesday, Dlamini and her estranged husband Quinton Jones issued a joint statement addressing the rumours of her cheating on Jones with Sodi. They said they were considering taking legal action over allegations that their marriage collapsed due to infidelity. In his post, Sodi also denied dating South African model and influencer Mihlali Ndamase. “I’ve never dated Minnie or Mihlali, I only met them once,” wrote Sodi on his social media platform. Sunday World reported at the weekend that the business partnership between Dlamini and Jones has crumbled following their much-publicised separation. The couple went separate ways in February and cited that they would focus on co-parenting their child.

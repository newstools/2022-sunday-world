Chippa United general manager Morgan Mammila and his agent Khumbulani Konco are working on a plan that will see the former administrator going far in his newfound career as a coach. Contrary to reports that Mammila was making a mockery of coaching, the former Baroka FC boss is taking it seriously, and has enlisted for Safa coaching badges. Konco, who is the Chilli Boys CEO and also serves as Mammila’s agent, revealed that Mammila has done his D Licence introductory course in Gqeberha, and that he will be going for more coaching qualifications in the future. “Morgan is very serious and focused on this coaching business. Yes, he’s done the introductory course and next year he is going for his Safa C Licence. Coaching him is a calling. He came up to us and said that he has a vision – and coaching augurs well with his personality,” said Konco. “He is a man of football, was born in football and has built his life around the game. People can definitely expect more from him. “He wants to be a head coach and once he sets his mind on something, he does not stop.” For the latest sports news from Sunday World, click here.

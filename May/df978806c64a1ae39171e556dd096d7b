Mohono, a DStv Viewer’s Choice Awards nominee in the favourite television presenter category, shared the news of her new radio gig on social media on Monday. Born in Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, the presenter wrote that dreams do come true. “My first show is this evening, and I’m both nervous and excited. I can’t wait!

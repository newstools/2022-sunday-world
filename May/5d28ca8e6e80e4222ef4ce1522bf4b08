Eskom has raised alarm following attacks on the power utility’s technicians in Mabopane and Soweto. The state-owned entity said the attacks pose a danger to the mental health of its workers, saying this also leads to delays in repairing the energy infrastructure in the townships. Kith Maitisa, Eskom’s safety, health, environment, risk and quality manager in Gauteng, condemned the attacks. “We condemn such acts of violence against our employees in Gauteng where they are often assaulted, intimidated and placed in extreme situations such as being held hostage by some community members,” said Maitisa. “This display of aggression and violence by communities often leads to employees suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. It also results in delays in repair work and project completion, further extending the period that residents spend without electricity.” At least three incidents have been reported over the past week. According to Eskom, three armed thieves attacked and robbed technicians while they were inspecting meter boxes in Mabopane Block E on Tuesday. It is alleged that the crew was robbed of cellphones and wallets. Eskom said two other attacks took place in Mabopane and Soweto, respectively, three days ago. “In a separate incident in Mabopane, a technician was also robbed of a cellphone and money at a substation. On 25 May 2022, another technician was stabbed while he and his crews were installing meters in Nomzamo, Soweto. “The technician, who was stabbed in the face and chest, was treated at a medical facility and is recovering at home.” Maitisa confirmed that these incidents were reported to the police, adding that the power utility would assist with the investigations.

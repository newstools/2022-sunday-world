Multi-award winning stage and TV actor Jamie Bartlett will be buried in Cape Town on Thursday, his family said on Tuesday, putting to rest conflicting reports about his send-off and memorial service. The family said the memorial service will take place on Monday in Soweto and added that further details will be shared at a later stage. Bartlett, 55, died in his sleep from cardiac arrest last Monday. “Jamie’s management will be holding a memorial service for all his loyal supporters and those who loved him,” said the family in a statement. Bartlett featured in many stage and TV productions portraying the roles of a villain including as Mike O’Reilly in Isidingo on SABC3 and David Genaro in Rhythm City on e.tv. He was also part of the judging panel on SA’s Got Talent on e.tv.   Also Read: Condolences pour in for actor Jamie Bartlett For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

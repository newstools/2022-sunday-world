Seun Kuti & Egypt 80 will headline this year’s MTN Bushfire to be held at Malkerns Valley in Eswatini from May 27 to May 29. After a two-year absence due to strict Covid-19 regulations that impacted outdoor events, the multi-cultural event is back with a bang. Many other artists across the continent are billed to perform at the three-day festival. Kuti is the youngest son of late Nigerian Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti. At 14, Seun became the leader of the Egypt 80, a 14-piece band that has wowed audiences across the world. Almost the entire band is made up of musicians who were often arrested and harassed alongside Kuti, the founder of the Afrobeat movement. From South Africa, the well-celebrated Ndlovu Youth Choir, Nasty C, The Kiffness, Blk Jks, Sun-EL Musician, DBN Gogo, and Msaki will also take to the stages of the much-anticipated event.

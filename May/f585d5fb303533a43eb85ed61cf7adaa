Three suspects implicated in the brutal killing of six-year-old Bontle Mashiyane will appear at the Kabokweni magistrate’s court in Mpumalanga on Monday. Two neighbours and a sangoma (traditional healer) are in police custody in connection with the murder. They are alleged to have also committed the murders of four other children. The mutilated body of Mashiyane, who was reported missing last month, was found on Saturday near her home. It was reported that Mashiyane was playing with other children near her home on the day she disappeared. The six-year-old was raped and stabbed, and her skull was found without the eyes, ears and and a tongue, according to Mpumalanga premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane, who visited the distraught family at the weekend. Provincial police commissioner Semakaleng Manamela said some of the suspects face rape, murder, and kidnapping charges.

Mpumalanga health MEC Sasekani Manzini has applauded the police for apprehending a suspect found in possession of stolen medical supplies. On Tuesday, the police informed Manzini that a female security guard based at Langverwact clinic in Embalenhle, Secunda had been arrested after she was found in possession of medical supplies stolen at two health facilities. The suspect is awaiting to appear in court on charges of theft. “Our people are always complaining that there is a shortage of medicine in our facilities, little did we know it is sometimes due to theft. We hope the security officer will be successfully prosecuted,” said Manzini. “This should be a warning to others who are doing the same, because we cannot allow such criminal acts to take place in the department, as it compromises health service delivery.” The spokesperson for the department, Dumisani Malamule, said the police conducted a raid at a house belonging to the suspect and confiscated various medical items and medical supplies. “The department’s officials were called to the scene to confirm whether the items found at the house belong to the department. That’s when the security guard confessed that she had stolen the medical items,” said Malamule. “She indicated that she took the items from Embalenhle CHC and Langverwact clinic. Forensic police took everything [found at the house] as evidence and she was immediately apprehended.” Manzini further called for more investigations into theft of medicine in the health facilities, saying she believes there could be a lot of criminal activities taking place at other facilities as well.

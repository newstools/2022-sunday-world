Award-winning media personality Bonang Matheba will co-host Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards next weekend. Matheba will be joined on stage by Nigerian TV personality IK Osakioduwa to present one of the biggest events on the African entertainment calendar, which will take place in Nigeria on May 14. Matheba said it was a great honour for her to host an event of this magnitude, sharing that she would be dressed by Nigerian designers. “I am working with a wonderful Nigerian fashion stylist called Damola. He will be in charge of all my looks. Fashion is huge in Lagos and looking good is part of my brand, so it is important that I look fabulous,” she said. Matheba also admitted that she still gets a fright when she takes to the stage. “Although I have been doing this for a long time, I do get nervous a bit, but once you are on stage, everything goes well.” The ever-stylish Matheba also shared that she is working on a number of projects, but said radio is none of them. “I have done that and I am done. My love for radio died a long time ago. I will never go there again,” she said, adding that she would be launching a non-alcoholic range of BNG soon. On the matters of the heart, she whispered that there is someone special in her life, although she is not ready to start a family. “I am definitely a happy girl. There is someone special in my life.” For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

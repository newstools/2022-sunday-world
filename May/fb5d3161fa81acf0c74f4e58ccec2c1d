The Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union on Wednesday took its grievances to the streets, marching to the Department of Health offices in Tshwane to hand over a memorandum of demands. Top of the list was a demand for the department to offer permanent employment to contracted health care workers, whom it said had been working in the front lines during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The union, which said the health care facilities are battling with shortages of staff, also wants hospitals refurbished. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 cases continue to soar, peaking at 3 785 in the past 24 hours. According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of South Africa, 1 685 of the new cases were identified in Gauteng, followed by 1 056 in KwaZulu-Natal, and Western Cape came third at 473.

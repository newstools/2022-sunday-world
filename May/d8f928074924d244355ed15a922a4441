It’s all to play for heading into the penultimate round of matches in the DStv Diski Challenge. The title race could be decided on Saturday or extended to a final-day showdown, or even bring back into the mix third-placed Orlando Pirates, according to supersport.com The only thing we know is that Stellenbosch FC and SuperSport United are the two teams with a real chance of being crowned champions. Third-placed Orlando Pirates, mathematically, are still in the hunt, but are out of it in reality. Stellenbosch have a tricky clash against unpredictable Maritzburg United on Saturday at Princess Magogo Stadium at 10am. SuperSport will be up against Golden Arrows on the same day at the same venue at 12.30pm. Pirates, who are now relying on other results, will face Baroka at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Sunday at 12.30pm. All the teams have played 28 matches.

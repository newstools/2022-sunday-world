Angry parents have shut down Thubelilhe High School in White City, Soweto after complaining of never-ending renovations that started five years ago. The school utilises mobile classrooms that the parents say are not in a good condition, alleging that some do not even have the windows and doors. They also complain that the school’s roofing is leaking and could collapsed, placing the lives of pupils at risk. The parents also alleged that the school’s drainage system is not working.

As the continent celebrated World Africa Day this week, alcohol brand Viceroy has reminded South Africans that they can reflect on their culture by viewing and participating in their Vul’Umlomo: Conversations on Culture concept. The platform, hosted by renowned soccer expert Robert Marawa, takes a deep dive into the relationship between money and culture. Vul’Umlomo directly translates to “open the mouth”, which is a platform that encourages communities to have open discussions. The company says through its multi-directional and conversational approach, South Africans can air their views and share their experiences as culture is an essential part of the lives of South Africans. Viceroy believes looking to the past is essential to understanding our roots and shaping the characters of the generations to come. Marawa said: “It’s become increasingly important to reserve the essence of who we are as African people. “A lot of our culture and its representation has been left open to interpretation from alternative sources. Being part of Vul’Umlomo enables a dialogue that reinforces the importance of our roots and shows how dynamic our culture is.” Richard Papo, marketing manager for Viceroy, said the first conversation drove the community to speak openly on their perspectives around cultural norms. “Our panellists drove the narrative, which helped the people better understand culture and fostered an environment where differences were accepted and identified.” The next session unpacked the implications of finances within culture and some associated practices such as lobola, “black tax” and spirituality. Joining Marawa were esteemed cultural experts Mbuso Khoza and Dr Bishop Jessica Mbangeni, Thabile Noxolo Buthelezi and traditionalist and spiritual adviser Siyabonga Mkhize.

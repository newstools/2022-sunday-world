Convicted killer cop Rosemary Ndlovu has been ordered to return to court on July 7 to answer to fresh criminal charges. Ndlovu appeared briefly at the Kempton Park magistrate’s court on Tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit murder. She is accused of allegedly plotting to kill Sergeant Keshi Mabunda and Colonel Nthipe Boloka. The plot was allegedly hatched while she was in jail following her arrest in 2018. Boloka was Ndlovu’s station commander at the Tembisa South police station where she worked before her arrest and incarceration, while Mabunda investigated the killing spree of her family members. Ndlovu is currently serving six life sentences for murder, attempted murder, defeating the ends of justice and fraud after she was found guilty of killing five members of her family and her partner in order to claim life insurance.

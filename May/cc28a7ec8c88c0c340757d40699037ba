Former Bosasa chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi is expected back at the specialised commercial crimes court in Palm Ridge on Wednesday to answer to charges of fraud and corruption. Agrizzi was arrested in 2020 alongside former ANC MP Vincent Smith. It is alleged that Smith received kickbacks from Agrizzi, on behalf of Bosasa, in exchange for political influence. Their cases have since been separated, though, because of Agrizzi’s ill-health and his repeated no-shows at court. Testifying at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture in 2019, Agrizzi threw several politicians under the bus when he alleged that they received money and gifts for Bosasa. The last time the case was before the court in April, Agrizzi’s legal team had been expected to move an application to have the magistrate rule that it was being delayed unreasonably. This after the State in 2021 said it wanted to appoint its own physician to examine Agrizzi, but then took several months to do. Bosasa specialised in providing services to government, most notably prison services. The company, which has been in liquidation since February 2019, is now called African Global Operations.

The Johannesburg magistrate’s court on Wednesday postponed former SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni’s case because she was reportedly sick and unable to attend court proceedings. She is expected to appear in court again on June 14. Myeni is facing criminal charges over her conduct at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into the Allegations of State Capture which was chaired by Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. In 2020, she took the stand at the commission and revealed the identity of a protected witness on camera during her testimony about her reign at the national carrier. Zondo warned her not to repeat the witness’s name, but Myeni went ahead and mentioned the name of the protected witness again, resulting in Zondo laying a criminal complaint against her. In January, part one of the State Capture Report highlighted serious inefficiencies in the country’s state-owned entities. The report laid bare what happened at the national carrier and its subsidiaries. It showed how Myeni got involved in operational matters when she had no business to do so, also bringing to the fore that there was a decline in the quality of governance from 2012 onwards at SAA. Zondo’s report revealed that Myeni was the chairperson of the airline’s board and created a climate of fear and intimidation. To read more political news and views, click here.

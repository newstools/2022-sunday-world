The City of Tshwane will stop offering ambulance services to its residents when the municipality’s temporary licence expires on May 15. The temporary licence to render emergency medical and ambulance services was granted by the provincial government during the National State of Disaster to allow the municipality to swiftly attend to Covid-19 cases. City spokesperson Ald Theunissen said the provincial government would now take full responsibility for the service. “Going forward, the rendering of emergency medical and ambulance services in the City of Tshwane will be carried out by the Gauteng Emergency Medical Services and other private services.” Theunissen added that the city’s emergency services department would continue to provide emergency medical treatment at all fire and rescue-related incidents. “Emergency medical treatment means to treat and stabilise a patient while awaiting an available ambulance to transport the patient to the nearest healthcare facility,” he said.

South Africa’s first lady in gossip, fashion and everything celebrity got a first glimpse of what the long-awaited fashion week had to offer to those of us who love their clothes. The official opening party of Mzansi’s biggest vogue event was held on Tuesday at the Mall of Africa in Midrand. Local musicians, actors, media personalities, influencers and yours in gossip of course, swanked in, elegantly dressed for the occasion by some of the best fashion designers in the country. As expected for every red-carpet event, there were those who nailed the theme and those that just decided to do whatever suits them, but still wanted to be seen. Rosetta Ncwana, are you trying to get back with hubby with those tits, or are you looking for someone else? Pamela Mtanga, you shouldn’t have bothered with the bottom part of your outfit, you could’ve gone for something better.  Gigi Lamayne, that shade of pink lipstick is not for you, honey, your lips looked as if you had gone for botox a couple of hours before the launch party.

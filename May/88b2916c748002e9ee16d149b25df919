Michael Jameson, a policeman who died trying to foil a hijacking, has been hailed as a hero by his colleagues who promise to bring his killers to book. The 52-year-old was killed outside his daughter’s school in Umbilo, Durban, where he had gone to pick her up when he noticed a crime in progress and responded. But the suspects opened fire and hit Jameson. He succumbed to his injuries at the scene. National police commissioner General Fannie Masemola said on Thursday the police were working around the clock to apprehend the suspects. “The late warrant officer died a hero as he died serving and protecting the people of this country. He indeed served with pride as he placed himself on duty and put the safety of his community before his own,” said Masemola. “Let me take this opportunity to pay gratitude to the deceased member. The bell has rung, thank you for your service and dedication to serve and protect. We will not rest until the killers are traced and apprehended to answer to this callous act.” The police have asked anyone with information on the whereabouts of the suspects to contact their nearest police station or call the Crime Stop Hotline number on 0860010111.

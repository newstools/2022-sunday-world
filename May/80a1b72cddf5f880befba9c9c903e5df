Kaizer Chiefs’ marketing and commercial director Jessica Motaung has been appointed to the Confederation of African Football’s (CAF) women football standing committee for the next two years. Making the announcement during a media briefing on Wednesday, Amakhosi said Motaung’s appointment comes after she attended a women’s football task force workshop organised by CAF in 2019. She was part of a group of 23 influencers and key stakeholders representing 17 African nations at the time. “We are very proud of our marketing director Jessica Motaung. We are happy to see one of our own grow and spread her wings in continental football. Being the only South African on the committee speaks volumes, it truly is a remarkable feat,” said Kaizer Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung. “We are confident she will add much value to CAF and women’s football on the continent given her experience that spans over two decades. We have watched the growth of the game over the last number of years and Jessica’s role will also help Safa [SA Football Association, PSL [Premier Soccer League], and Kaizer Chiefs as we look to move in the direction of expanding our ladies’ participation in football.” She expressed her gratitude to CAF president Patrice Motsepe and the rest of the leadership for her appointment. “It is also important to thank my chairman, Mr Kaizer Motaung, for his support and blessings. I would not have achieved this if it were not for his wisdom and great leadership. “I would also like to say thank you to the PSL chairman, Dr Irvin Khoza, who upon receiving the news, conveyed his good wishes.” For the latest sport news from Sunday World, click here.

Unknown gunmen stormed the Louis Trichardt diesel depot and shot an employee before stealing fuel worth millions of rands. In a statement, the police in Limpopo said six trucks were filled with diesel before the armed robbers fled the scene at the weekend, leaving their victim critically injured. It is alleged that the manager of the depot opened the gate for one truck, which entered the business premises under the pretense of buying fuel. Once inside, the occupants jumped out with firearms and took a remote control, cellphones, and an undisclosed amount of cash from the manager. “During the robbery, a company driver who was sitting in a truck parked at the premises was shot and seriously injured,” said provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe. “The suspects then came in driving six trucks and filled them up with diesel worth R5.5-million before they drove off.” The 43-year-old man who was injured was rushed to the hospital where he is recovering.

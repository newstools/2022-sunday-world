Businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize is making a comeback to reality TV with a new two-part special show on BET Africa. The show is based on a thanksgiving ceremony she hosted in April that she said was a celebration of God and her ancestors. Friends and family were invited to the ceremony that brought together culture and glam. From what she has shared on social media, Shauwn can also be seen riding on a camel as she entered the venue of the ceremony, which was marked by five outfit changes. “I’m over the moon that I finally got to have my thanksgiving. Now I get to share the whole experience with you in this two-part special exclusive,” she wrote.  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

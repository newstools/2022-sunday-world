Charmza Kudos to advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi for his poignant argument at the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) against AfriForum’s push for the continued public display of the old apartheid flag. Representing the Nelson Mandela Foundation, Ngcukaitobi put it to the SCA that the old flag represents “a yearning for the return of apartheid”. Both the foundation and the SA Human Rights Commission are opposing AfriForum’s appeal against an earlier Equality Court ruling declaring displays of the flag hate speech.

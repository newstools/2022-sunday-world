Hip-hop musician Cassper Nyovest is the latest Mzansi celebrity to become a victim of fraud. Cassper shared on social media that one of his bank cards was cloned by someone he does not know. Card cloning, also known as counterfeiting, is a process where a genuine bank card’s magnetic strip is copied and placed onto a duplicate card. The musician said he was confused how his bank would allow someone to steal his money, and how easy it was for someone to clone a bank card. He is also not sure how much was stolen from the account. “It took me a while to notice, so I don’t know how much they really stole, but I want to know how is it so easy to get a card cloned,” he wrote.

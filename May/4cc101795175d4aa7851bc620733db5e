Red-hot Mamelodi Sundowns attacking midfielder Aubrey Modiba has shared that it is not easy to win the league. Modiba scored a top-drawer volley against Kaizer Chiefs on Sunday, his third goal in as many matches. Many pundits and supporters are beginning to call the Premier Soccer League (PSL) a farmer’s league – a term used by the supporters to mock a league that is not competitive or one that is dominated by a single club, such as the Bundesliga in Germany, and French Ligue 1 in France – where only one team has been winning the league for many years, and doing it with a lot of matches still go on the fixture list. Sundowns have now won the PSL for the fifth time in succession. Since the inception of the PSL in 1996, they have also won it for an incredible 12 times, with both Chiefs and Orlando Pirates a mere four times. The Soweto giants are no longer at the summit of SA football and the Brazilians have taken over, and also making inroads into the African territory in the CAF club competitions. Modiba shared: “Winning the league is not as easy as it looks. We need to outsmart our opponents and use our strength to win games. Our work has been good and we have been doing well, but I would not say that it’s been easy. “We had to fight and make sure [that] we did well and outrun our opponents. We are family, we are a unit, and we help each other and fight for one another. That has been helpful in winning our matches.” He added: “As a player, you want to compete and to win the league. Now I have won the second league and hopefully we can achieve more and keep on winning more titles to go back and play in the CAF Champions League. I believe I made the right move to join Sundowns.” For the latest sports news from Sunday World, click here.

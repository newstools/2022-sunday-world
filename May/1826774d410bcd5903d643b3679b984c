South African Gospel music giant Deborah Fraser was finally laid to rest at the Lalakahle Private Cemetery in Durban on Tuesday . Her scheduled burial on Saturday was postponed due to floods that caused havoc in KwaZulu-Natal over the weekend. After Fraser’s funeral service that was held at the Station Venue on Saturday, the undertaker advised that it was not safe for the family to bury her due to the heavy rains. The family’s spokesperson, Busi Shibodze, said her body had to be returned to the undertakers. “The undertaker advised the family that it was no safe to go to the graveyard because at the time the rain was coming down hard. Her body was taken back to the mortuary,” said Shibodze. The Abanye Bayombona singer, died at the age of 56 on Sunday last week at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital.

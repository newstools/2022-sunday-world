Teenage pregnancy and drug abuse among children remain the biggest challenge facing the country, according to Deputy Minister of Social Development Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu. Launching the Child Protection Week at the weekend, Bogopane-Zulu said the “blessers” and peer pressure have been identified as the main reasons for the scourge. “These men that sleep with young girls are outright rapists. These men are called 4M’s because they are ‘masculine mobile men with money’ who prey on young girls, be careful of them,” said Bogopane-Zulu. “We also have the responsibility to lead with the right things as a nation and ensure that teenage pregnancy and rape become a thing of the past.” In a nationwide drive to spread the message about child protection, the department visited the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, as well as other areas that show high statistics of teenage pregnancy, rape, and abduction of children who are then married to older men. Under this year’s theme “Let us all protect children during Covid-19 and beyond”, the department has partnered with the Department of Health and the Department of Justice to share knowledge and information on how to combat these social ills. “We urge parents to stop focusing on money while their children are being raped. Open the channels of communication and report teenage pregnancy, child abuse and neglect,” Bogopane-Zulu added. Child Protection Week started on Sunday and wraps up on Sunday, June 5.

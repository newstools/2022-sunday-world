The Western Cape High Court will on Wednesday hear public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s grievances following parliament’s decision to proceed with an inquiry into her fitness to hold office.

According to Mkhwebane, the president must not be allowed to suspend her because he is conflicted. This after a number of complaints against Ramaphosa that Mkhwebane is investigating. Parliament announced last week that the embattled public protector would appear before a parliamentary Committee for Section 194 Enquiry to defend herself in July. In a statement last week, Mkhwebane expressed her concerns and stated that she is not pleased that the committee had resolved to go ahead with the impeachment inquiry, but said she had nothing to hide and does not have issues with the inquiry if it is “lawful”. “The public protector is on record that any lawful inquiry should proceed as soon as possible. She is confident that no legitimate inquiry will find her guilty of the charges brought by the Democratic Alliance [DA],” said Mkhwebane’s office. “However, the decision to start an inquiry in the present atmosphere, which is littered with allegations of conflicts of interest, illegality and even alleged corruption and other criminal conduct, is totally unacceptable.” Mkhwebane is not giving up without a fight as she believes that the impeachment process is tainted and should not go ahead.

A 21-year-old Mozambican man accused of the murder of policeman Joseph Jongile during a house robbery in East London last year will be sentenced today. German Billa and his two accomplices broke into Jongile’s house and forced his son at gunpoint to knock at the main house, said the police in a statement. Police spokesperson Captain Yolisa Mgolodela explained: “On hearing the commotion, Jongile went downstairs to salvage the situation where he was shot. He died instantly. “The other house occupants were tied and placed in separate bedrooms. The gunmen ransacked the house and took valuables including cellphones, laptops, money, and bank cards. The intruders fled the scene with the stolen baggage.” Billa pleaded guilty and will be sentenced on Thursday, while the two other suspects are still at large.

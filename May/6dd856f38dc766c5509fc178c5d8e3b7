Eskom announced on Monday afternoon that it would implement stage 2 loadshedding from 5pm until 10pm tonight. The power utility had warned earlier in the day that it might implement power cuts at short notice if it experienced more challenges. It said earlier on today: “While the power system has recovered sufficiently to fully meet the demand during the day, Eskom would like to caution the public that loadshedding might be required at short notice during the evening peaks, should there be further breakdowns in current available capacity.” Eskom also said it expected to return to service two generation units before evening to increase its capacity and assist with the evening peak. “Should any of these units fail to return as expected, the power system will be severely constrained, presenting an increased probability of loadshedding at short notice. “The return to service of a generation unit each at Matimba and Lethabo, as well as two units each at Hendrina and three at Tutuka power stations, have been delayed, increasing the evening peak constraints,” said Eskom.

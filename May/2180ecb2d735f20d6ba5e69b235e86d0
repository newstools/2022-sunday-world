The battle of fake accents in Mzansi is officially on … Shwa just loves how these have just been acquired and wow… are they dodgy… Did KZN finance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube recently attend a Model C night school specializing in teaching accents to former township kids from the 1980s? Or did she just wake up one morning and decide to speak isiZulu in shwingshwang? Listening to her is a real cringe fest, stru! No sister, polish that accent before those KZNers listen to you gunning for that chairperson position with that. You know how your peeps safeguard their lingo… Better get your act, or should I say “shwang” together, alright! For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

The South African Student Congress (Sasco) has condemned an “attack” on a black University of Stellenbosch student at the weekend. In a statement on Monday, Sasco said the “racial” incident took place on campus when a drunk white student entered a room occupied by the black student at 4am and urinated on his laptop and books. The student body added that the white student also allegedly asked to be recorded. Asked by the black student why he was behaving badly, the white student is said to have responded: “This is what we do to black boys.” The matter has been reported to relevant authorities and Sasco is calling for the expulsion of the white student and for him to face criminal charges. “We call for fast and swift justice for the indignity suffered by the fellow [black] student, who is still traumatised by the whole ordeal,” said Sasco. The university is expected to release a statement later on Monday.

A memorial service for late Gomora actor Siyabonga Zubane will be held at the Joburg Theatre on Thursday. The 23-year-old played Sdumo, a crook and carjacker on the much-loved TV drama series. He was found dead at a home he was renting in Soweto on Saturday after he allegedly died by suicide. His memorial service will take place between 2pm and 5pm. Writer and actor Chris Q Radebe said he was having a hard time coming to terms with Zubane’s death, stating that he had so many hopes for him and had witnessed what a talented young actor Zubane was. <img class="alignnone wp-image-187238 size-full" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/memorial-e1652259453788.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="520" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/memorial-e1652259453788.jpeg 375w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/memorial-e1652259453788-180x250.jpeg 180w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/memorial-e1652259453788-303x420.jpeg 303w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /> “It’s 21h56 and Lulu [one of the producers of the TV drama series] still hasn’t called. But we’re not going to give up. We will wait. She will call. Siyabonga can’t leave us like that,” wrote Radebe. “Not when we love him so much. Not when he owes us so many iconic scenes. He can’t just leave us like that. It just wouldn’t be fair,” wrote Radebe.

Former assistant state attorney Nosipho Zibani, Yolanda Tebogo Hlatshwayo, Phindile Zibani and Ntandokazi Trading have been ordered by the Special Tribunal to pay back more than R4.4-million with interest. This after they were found to have fraudulently claimed for midwifery medico-legal services from Gauteng health department between 2016 and 2017. Special Investigating Unit (SIU) head of stakeholder relations and communications Kaizer Kganyago said in a statement: “Hlatshwayo purportedly issued invoices to the state attorney in matters assigned to Nosipho as the attorney of record for the MEC when Hlatshwayo did not render such services. The invoices were purportedly in relation to midwifery medico-legal services Hlatshwayo rendered in the relevant matters.” Added Kganyago: “A probe in the state attorney’s accounting department shows nine fraudulent invoices amounting to R4.4-million by Ntandokazi Trading, which were authorised and paid by the former assistant state attorney. “The findings prompted the launch of disciplinary proceedings against Nosipho. She resigned from the office of the state attorney before the disciplinary proceedings commenced.” On Wednesday, the Special Tribunal ruled that Zibani and allies are to jointly pay the Gauteng MEC R4 452, 351, 81 and a further R135 000 in fraudulent claims and damages respectfully. Kganyago said the Special Tribunal also ordered the forfeiture of pension benefits to the value of R798 939, 34 held with the Government Employees Pension Fund, which belongs to Zibani. “The SIU was granted a preservation order for pension benefits on 10 October 2020, pending the finalisation of the legal action.” For more political news: https://www.sundayworld.co.za/category/politics/ Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

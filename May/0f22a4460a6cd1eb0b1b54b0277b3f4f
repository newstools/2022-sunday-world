Moegoe “The devil made me to do it.” These were the words of Eastern Cape lawyer Yandisa Babalwa Mjikelo when she was sentenced to 15 years in jail after she pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and of money laundering. Mjikelo said the devil had influenced her crooked ways after she fleeced clients’ insurance funds at Vapi Incorporated Attorneys in Mthatha. She was sentenced to 15 years on each of the charges, to run concurrently for fraud involving amounts of between R128 000 and R1.4-million. Why invoke the devil, Babalwa? You’re just a criminal.

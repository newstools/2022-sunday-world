The Kempton Park magistrate’s court on Wednesday postponed convicted killer cop Rosemary Ndlovu’s case to May 31. Ndlovu briefly appeared in court to answer to new charges of conspiracy to commit murder. She is accused of plotting to kill Sergeant Keshi Mabunda and Colonel Nthipe Boloka, who was her station commander at the Tembisa south police station where she worked. Ndlovu is currently serving six life sentences for murder, attempted murder, defeating the ends of justice and fraud after she was found guilty of killing five members of her family and her partner in order to claim life insurance. Mabunda investigated the killing spree of Ndlovu’s family members, who is alleged to have plotted the murders of Mabunda and Boloka from behind bars following her arrest in March 2018. Ndlovu and her co-accused Nomsa Mudau, also a former cop, allegedly also plotted to murder Mudau’s ex-husband, Justice Mudau.

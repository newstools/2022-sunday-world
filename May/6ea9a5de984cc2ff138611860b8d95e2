Smiso Zwane, popularly known by his stage name Okmalumkoolkat, has cancelled all his shows and will not be honouring invitations to parties following the death of his father. His father, who never played an active role in the singer’s upbringing, died on Friday last week, three weeks before the muso releases a new album. Okmalumkookat opened up on social media and wrote that although his father had never been around in his life, he has since made peace with his absence and has forgiven him. “Father wasn’t around so it’s a weird time. I’ve moved on and forgiven him, but tears aren’t manufacturing the way they are supposed to,” he wrote.    For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

Nathi Mthethwa and his Department of Sport, Arts and Culture cronies have been defending the indefensible – the R22-million SA flag monument. To the delight of the South African public, Mthethwa and co have decided to reverse, for now, the erection of the monumental flag in Pretoria. When the final decision is made against the flag worth millions of rand, we hope that the money will be put to good use to help struggling artists or invest in rural sports development. Who does not know what the SA flag looks like?

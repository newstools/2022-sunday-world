The University of Zululand’s KwaDlangezwa campus yesterday suspended academic activity following protests by students who threatened to burn down the institution. The shutdown has since forced hundreds of students to pack up and leave. The violent protest was triggered allegedly by a lack of university security for students who live off-campus, with the protesting group citing an increase in rape cases, murder and gangsterism in recent weeks.    University management said in a statement that it had decided to suspend academic activity to protect the lives of other students, its staff, and the university’s property. It said: “The management has decided to suspend teaching and learning on the university campus with immediate effect. Management cannot sit idle while individuals purporting to be students commit criminal acts of thuggery, damage to property, theft, and threat to human life. “Students will be informed in due course of what measures will be implemented to safeguard the academic programme.” For more education news from Sunday World, click here.

Eskom has delivered some reprieve and announced that loadshedding will be downgraded to stage 3 from 9pm on Thursday to 5am on Friday. “Thereafter, stage 2 will be implemented until 5am on Monday, as previously communicated,” said Eskom in a statement, adding that the emergency generation reserves had sufficiently improved to permit the reduction of loadshedding. On Wednesday, the power utility escalated rolling power cuts from stage 2 to stage 4 until Friday morning. It cited several breakdowns in its power generating units.

The Gauteng government is revamping its popular Tshepo programme, the province’s premier David Makhura said this week. The first iteration of this programme, Tshepo 500 000, was meant to bridge the gap between young people and the opportunities for them to earn a livelihood. It ran from 2014 to 2016 and reached 211 642 young people. The Tshepo programme is, however, by no means the only initiative the Gauteng government has embarked on to alleviate the plight of youth unemployment. Youth job opportunities fact box: • The province also trained 3 339 unemployed youth in automotive skills, including 1 217 female youth and 2 122 male youth, and 348 people have also been trained at the Gauteng Automotive Learning Centre.

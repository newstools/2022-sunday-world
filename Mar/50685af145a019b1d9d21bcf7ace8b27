She said the common hair types such as 3C, which is curly hair, is defined by having an S-shaped curl pattern, 4A is known as kinky or coily and can easily be dehydrated and damaged, 4B bends into sharp angles like the letter Z with a curl that is less defined. “The 4C hair type is more susceptible to tangles, matting and knots because its strands are so tightly coiled, they’re more prone to wrap around each other and cause tangles,” shared Shibur. “It craves moisture as it does not retain it as well as other curl patterns do, and it dries out rather quickly. And 4C coils are prone to breakage.” Shibur said with 4C natural hair being one of the tightest hair textures, it also comes in various densities and porosity types. But it has qualities that make it easily noticeable compared to other curl patterns.

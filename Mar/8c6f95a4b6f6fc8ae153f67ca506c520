DJ and TV personality Lesego Nkaiseng, fondly known as DJ Speedsta, has bowed out of Metro FM. In his parting shot, Speedsta thanked his colleagues and said he was tired of everything, not revealing much about what he meant. “Today is a sad one for me, but an interesting one. I sacrificed my Saturday nights, sacrificed my gigs, missed plenty of weddings, plenty Saturday nights, missed a lot of time with people who care for me. I told the Lord last year that there’s no way I’m doing that any longer, and here we are,” wrote Speedsta in his social media account. Speedsta, who presented the Absolute Hip Hop Show with Lootlove between 8pm and 10pm on Saturdays, joined the radio station five years ago. He shared that while he was on vacation in Amsterdam in 2017, Metro FM called him with an offer for a job. At the time, he was working for YFM and had to use up all his savings to buy himself out of the contract with the Joburg-based youth radio station.

Award-winning actress Lorcia Cooper-Khumalo was this week admitted to the Morningside Hospital in Johannesburg for the removal of lipoma. The Lockdown and The Estate actress shared on Instagram that she was grateful to the staff and her doctor for taking good care of her before, during and after a surgical procedure. A lipoma is a slow-growing fatty lump or tumor just below the skin and the underlying muscle layer. It is not cancerous and some people can have more than one lipoma. Lipoma commonly occurs in the neck, shoulders, back, abdomen, arms, and thighs. The condition can only be treated through a surgical procedure, if it causes discomfort and sleepless nights. “Finally had a lipoma removed. Just wanted to acknowledge my brilliant Dr Marias and the staff at the Morningside Clinic,” wrote Lorcia.  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

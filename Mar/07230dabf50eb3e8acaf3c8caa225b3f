The AmaZulu royal faction has chosen to remain mum on their next course of action after President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday night recognised MisuZulu kaZwelithini as the undisputed king of AmaZulu nation. In a statement issued by the Office of the Presidency, Ramaphosa said: “In terms of the requirements of the act, the royal family identified Prince MisuZulu Sinqobile Zulu as the person who qualifies in terms of the customary law and customs to assume the position of king and applied to the president for his recognition.” He said the recognition of MisuZulu followed consultations with the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and the KwaZulu-Natal premier Sihle Zikalala. While political parties in the province were quick to send their congratulatory messages to MisuZulu, his siblings are keeping their cards close to the chest refusing to pronounce on their next move. The faction led by MisuZulu’s uncle Prince Mbonisi Zulu and his aunt Princess Thembi Ndlovu challenged his nomination to the throne. When asked to comment on the latest developments, Prince Mbonisi Zulu said: “There is nothing to say at the moment.” MisuZulu will ascend the throne left vacant by the sudden passing of his father, the much-revered AmaZulu monarch Zwelithini kaBhekuZulu in March 2021. His ascendancy to the throne was marred by litigation and skirmishes with siblings preferring his older brother Prince Simakade Zulu to rule over the nation. The faction, dubbed the royal dissidents, had written to Ramaphosa saying he should stall the process of announcing a new king because they had not agreed on the name as a family. The faction contended that the core AmaZulu royal family and the royal council will recommend and appoint the next king. The bad blood and divisions at the royal house were laid bare at the weekend when two opposing factions hosted separate cleansing ceremonies in KwaKhangelamankengane and KwaKhethomthandayo palaces to mark a year since the passing of Zwelithini. Ramaphosa’s announcement gives the green light for MisuZulu’s coronation, which had been blocked numerous times.

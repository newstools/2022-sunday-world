Royal AM Football Club chairman Andile Mpisane is spreading the spirit of Ubuntu in commemoration of his 21st birthday by giving back to struggling university students. Mpisane, who celebrated his birthday on Tuesday, expressed his willingness to give away R10 000 to 21 university students who have recurring debts from 2021. “In celebration of my 21st birthday this year, we are back again with the #RoyalAMFeesMustFall movement,” he wrote on his social media account. Mpisane, the youngest chairman in the Premier Soccer League, said instead of handing out the cash to the beneficiaries, the funds would be paid directly to their institutions of high learning. The closing date for submissions from all the deserving students is March 18. The beneficiaries would be announced three days later on Monday 21.  The son of Shauwn “Mamkhize” Mkhize also announced that he has signed up with record label Def Jam Recordings Africa. The deal follows his performance during the Legends of the Streets concert in the US, where he featured as the opening act.

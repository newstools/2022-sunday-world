Shwa is really getting fed up with tennis player  Naomi Osaka who now seems to make everything an issue. To be a sportsman, you need to have the mental capacity to deal with haters and hecklers. It takes balls of steel to survive and be a champ. But to now cry around every corner. Imagine the mighty Mike Tyson crying every time people made fun of his voice? Shwa is all about being woke – but sometimes, haai, it’s too much. Serena Williams must come to teach this one, or she should just quit the game.

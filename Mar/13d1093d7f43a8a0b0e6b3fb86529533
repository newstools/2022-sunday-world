Comair-operated British Airways and Kulula.com flights will on Thursday take back to the skies following their suspension at the start of the week. The SA Civil Aviation Authority (Sacaa) grounded the airlines following safety concerns, which resulted in their air operators’ certificates being withdrawn. Comair CEO Glenn Orsmond said after a thorough review of the airline’s documentation, the Sacaa had decided to lift the precautionary suspension of the licence. He explained: “Our focus is now to get our operations back to normal as quickly as possible so we can further assist our customers.” The airline said the customers who were affected by the cancellation of flights would be contacted directly. Orsmond added that the past four days had demonstrated the implications of having so much capacity removed from the market at such short notice, noting that having Comair’s operational capability restored is good news for customers, employees, the flying public, and the aviation sector. Sacaa’s inspection aimed to review Comair’s safety management systems and quality control management systems to establish compliance related to the reporting, analysis and follow-up on occurrences, and corrective action plans to prevent a recurrence.

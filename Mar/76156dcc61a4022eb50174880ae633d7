Actor Bruce Willis, whom fans have come to love for the never-ending Die Hard films, has quit the acting industry. His daughter Rumer Willis issued a statement on behalf of the family this week stating that her 67-year-old father had no choice but quit due to a debilitating illness. Diagnosed with a brain disease called aphasia, the actor’s cognitive abilities would be affected, she explained. Aphasia is an inability to comprehend or formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions. The major causes are stroke and head trauma. Aphasia can also be the result of brain tumors, brain infections, or neurodegenerative diseases, but the latter are far less prevalent. <img class="wp-image-180618 size-full alignnone" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BruceStatement.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1292" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BruceStatement.jpg 1070w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BruceStatement-209x250.jpg 209w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BruceStatement-669x800.jpg 669w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BruceStatement-768x919.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BruceStatement-696x833.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BruceStatement-1068x1278.jpg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BruceStatement-351x420.jpg 351w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" />

Rappers AKA and Cassper Nyovest will headline this year’s Cotton Fest, forming part of 130 other artists who have confirmed their participation in the two-day festival in April. The brainchild of late rapper Riky Rick, the festival, which celebrates popular South African music and fashion, has been billed for April 23 and 24 at The Station, Carr Street in Newtown, Johannesburg. The weekend urban music and fashion explosion was first scheduled to take place in February but had to be postponed as a result of Riky Rick’s sudden death. Event organisers said the festival will merge both well-known and emerging South African artists over three “killer” stages. “Some of the cool things that cotton eaters can enjoy on site will be a games area, super-cool food court, a live skating competition, cotton fest x puma customisation station, a retail fashion ‘tuckshop’ featuring Cotton Fest merch, and limited-edition clothing items. Also, there will be a half-court and live art to engage with on site,” said the organisers in a statement. They said phase-two tickets are available via Webtickets and Pick n Pay outlets nationwide from Friday.  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

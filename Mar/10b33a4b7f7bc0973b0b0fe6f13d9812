Following the announcement, the many celebrities took to social media to express their disappointment at the power cuts. They also touched on how government is failing in its mandate to deliver clean water, repair poor infrastructure, and fight gender-based violence. Actress Pearl Thusi said: “Things are bad with our government. if it’s not airlines, its Eskom/power. The potholes are getting worse, water supply has been problematic, inflation … public schools need so much more attention…” Her sentiments were shared by YouTuber Mihlali Ndamase, who shared that she has not had power for four hours.

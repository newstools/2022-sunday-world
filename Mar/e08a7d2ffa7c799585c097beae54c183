Former Scandal! actress Joyce Skefu is recovering after suffering a mild stroke. Skefu took to social media to share her health condition with followers after a short spell of inactivity. She said she had started therapy sessions to help her recover quick and fully. “I was quiet because I had a mild stroke [and I] got hospitalised. But God did it again, I am doing therapies and getting better daily,” she wrote. A mild stroke happens when the blood flow to a part of the brain, spinal cord, or retina temporarily stops. It does not harm the brain cells or cause permanent disability, because the blockage is able to correct itself quickly.  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

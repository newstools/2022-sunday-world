The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) will continue to work with the National Prosecuting Authority and the Hawks to bring to justice the individuals implicated in wrongdoing in government. This follows the arrest of Jabulani Rolland Nkosi, the acting head of department at the Mpumalanga education department. Nkosi was arrested on Friday for contravening various sections of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). He appeared at the Nelspruit magistrate’s court and was released on R10 000 bail. The matter was remanded to April 20 for further investigation. SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said in a statement: “The SIU investigation into the procurement of personal protective equipment [PPE] by the education department revealed that Jabulani Rolland Nkosi, in his capacity as the accounting officer during the period May 2020, allegedly failed to comply with the provisions of the PFMA in procuring a number of PPE items to the value of R21.9-million. “Nkosi was seconded from the Mpumalanga department of health to the position of the accounting officer. He has since returned to his position as chief director in the [provincial] health department.” Kganyago added that the SIU will approach the special tribunal to review and set aside the PPE tender, and to recover financial losses incurred by the provincial government and the department.

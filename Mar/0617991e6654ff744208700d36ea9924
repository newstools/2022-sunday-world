The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) has commenced with efforts to stabilise the entity by filling key vacant positions occupied by acting incumbents. “Among the key targets we had agreed to, following years of haemorrhaging critical engineering and project management capacity, is stabilising the company by filling key vacancies at senior management level,” Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said on Tuesday. Addressing a virtual meeting of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) on PRASA, Mbalula said efforts to stabilise the company also include recovering commuter rail operations in the 10 priority corridors, while paying serious attention to operational safety and security. While progress is being made towards filling key vacancies, a number of critical positions are occupied by acting incumbents. “As on 28 February 2022, a total of 737 employees were acting in various roles across the PRASA Group at a cost of R8 843 649.77. PRASA currently has over 3 500 vacancies nationally. “This represents a vacancy rate of 19%, which remains unacceptably high.  This is a matter that remains on our radar and progress on lowering this rate to acceptable levels will be monitored and reported on quarterly,” the Minister said. The Minister said since the board’s appointment, government has been emphatic on the need to expedite the review of PRASA’s organisational design and business model in order to make the necessary and suitable changes to the structure and model of the Group. “The review of the organisational design was undertaken by the board and subjected to independent assessment, which have since been concluded. “The new operating model and organisational design will be implemented in a phased manner, commencing at the beginning of the new financial year.” The following key positions have acting incumbents: – SAnews.gov.za

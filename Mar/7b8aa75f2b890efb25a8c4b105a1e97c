Moja Love is saddened by the sudden death of Ongeziwe “Malwandle” Madonsela, of one of the cast members of the popular reality TV show Umndeni. The channel’s editor in chief, Nonzwakazi Cekete, on Wednesday refused to reveal the cause of death, saying only the family of the deceased will announce what led to the death of Malwandle, the show’s colourful spirit who brought life to the production. Cekete said: “Moja Love extends its condolences to his family and friends. May God give them the strength and healing through this difficult time, and may his soul rest in peace.” Umndeni explores the lives of men who are in polygamous relationships with other men and women. Malwandle was featured on season one of the reality show where he was in a relationship with Kolobe. In the second season, Malwandle came back as one of the wives of Maseko after he had cut romantic ties with Kolobe. He shared Maseko with five other sister wives including his brother Lwazi. However, he was kicked out of Maseko’s house following a quarrel with another wife of Maseko, prompting Lwazi to also pack up and leave the polygamous relationship. In one of the episodes recently, Malwandle mistakenly shared that Lwazi had died, when in fact he was admitted to the hospital after being stabbed by a jealous boyfriend. Messages of condolences continued to pour in after the announcement of Malwandle’s death, and Lwazi has appealed to the fans of the show to contribute towards his brother’s burial.

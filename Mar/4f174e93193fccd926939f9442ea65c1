Power utility Eskom announced on Monday afternoon that load-shedding stage two will be implemented from 5pm until 5am on Wednesday as a result of more breakdowns at power stations, including Medupi. Earlier in a statement, the power utility had said load-shedding would begin at 9pm on Tuesday until Wednesday 5am. In a statement released on Monday, Eskom said this was due to multiple generating unit failures over the past 24 hours. “Load-shedding might be required at short notice should there be any further significant breakdowns,” reads the statement.

Absa has appointed Arrie Rautenbach as CEO and executive director with immediate effect, the banking giant said on Tuesday. Rautenbach takes over from Jason Quinn who replaced Daniel Mminele as CEO in April 2021. Quinn, who was the banking group’s chief financial officer at the time, plugged the gap on interim basis after Mminele stepped down. Mminele had been in the hot seat for less than two years. Before taking charge at Absa, Mminele was the deputy governor at the South African Reserve Bank, where he served for about 20 years in different roles. Rautenbach, who has held several senior positions within Absa, holds a bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business administration from the University of North-West. He also completed an advanced management programme at INSEAD. To read more business news from Sunday World, click here.

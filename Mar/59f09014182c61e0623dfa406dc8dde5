Actor and comedian Siyabonga Radebe, one of the many new faces joining the SABC1 telenovela Uzalo for its brand new season, has been cast as a thug because of similar roles he’s played before. This time Radebe takes on the character of Vikizitha Magwaza, a charming but lethal criminal with his eyes fixed on Nkunzi’s throne. “Viki is your regular township thug, which is the type of role that I have been made to play in many different shows since the beginning of my career. I guess they figured I am experienced in playing that kind of character.” After being away from Durban for a long spell, Radebe believes he will gradually adapt to change. Radebe explained: “I find myself in Durban, a province I have not been part of since my early twenties. “Most of the actors I know are people I went to varsity with, so I am guessing with time I will find my place.” Pepsi Pokane of Stained Glass said the production house is excited about the changes that Uzalo fans will experience. Pokane shared: “The production team promises a season of high-stakes drama, riveting storylines, creativity, and skillful production. “We have several new faces joining the show, and it is a great pleasure to work with this impressive talent. We are confident that our viewers are eager to continue experiencing authentic stories that represent their everyday realities in a way that resonates with them.” Other new characters include Thembi Nyandeni, Omuhle Gela, Ronald Mkhwanazi, Thabisile Zikhali, Sthembile Mhlongo, Hope Mbhele, and Sandile Mfusi.

A heart-warming hug between Mamelodi Sundowns striker Pavol Šafranko and the club’s former captain Hlompho Kekana left fans emotional and giving praise. In a video that went viral on social media “Bra Hlompho”, as Kekana is affectionately called in football, is seen engaging and sharing a touching gesture with the goal-poacher.  Kekana shocked soccer fans when he cut ties with Sundowns in November 2021. He had just signed a four-year contract extension with the club. Following the announcement of his departure, Bafana Ba Style bid farewell to their long-serving captain, who helped the club lift many trophies during his spell. Šafranko only had a short time rubbing shoulders with Kekana after he arrived at Chloorkop in July 2021. Taking to his Twitter account, Kekana said: “In a world full of uncertainty, be kind always.” Fans commended the respect that Šafranko displayed to his former teammate:     https://twitter.com/ELaundrette/status/1499686080035098624?s=20&t=uWzVdk582g0PqWMxlMlDvQ

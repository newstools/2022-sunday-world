Former Miss South Africa and businesswoman Bokang Montjane-Tshabalala has added another feather to her cap. Montjane-Tshabalala announced on her Instagram account that she is now the director of Miss Intercontinental South Africa, one of the top eight pageants in the world. The Limpopo-born stunner took over the reigns of Miss SA in 2010 and has always been passionate about empowering women platforms. She also works closely with her soccer legend husband Siphiwe Tshabalala in their many foundations. “Last year when I said I really wanted to be a change-maker and get fully involved again in the pageant industry, I meant it. For me to have a licence of one of the top eight biggest pageants in the world means so much to me,” shared Montjane-Tshabalala. “I hope we continue to teach the world that beauty is multi-faceted, that beauty is not just on the outside but within as well. I hope to groom and mentor more young women just as I have had others groom and mentor me.” She wrote: “12 years ago when I got crowned as Miss South Africa, my life changed forever. And so here I am, years later, affording the same opportunities for young women that are around the same age that I was when I won Miss South Africa. “I really hope this becomes a platform that empowers the young women and helps them become the best version of themselves.”    The beauty highlighted that entries for Miss Intercontinental South Africa are now open and they are free. “So, if you are between the ages of 18-27, come and enter Miss Intercontinental South Africa and represent South Africa.” For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

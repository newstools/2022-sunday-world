A march by members of the EFF has been called off after the North Gauteng High Court granted the City of Tshwane an interdict, said mayor Randall Williams in a statement on Monday, stating that the EFF is not a labour organisation. The protest march, which the city had termed “illegal”, aimed to call for the reinstatement of 600 municipal workers fired by the City of Tshwane.

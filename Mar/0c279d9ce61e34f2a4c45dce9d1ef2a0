Shwa is not Miss Perfect but these constant celebrity feuds we see playing out in public are worrying; time is not on our side. Nobody knows when they will take their last breath. Celebrity feuds have become a huge part of the entertainment industry, and fans ignite these feuds on social media. Let it be known that most of them are petty and childish if I must say so myself. Fix things so your mental health can benefit and you won’t be left with regrets after the fact. Unathi and Sizwe please fix things. Shwa understands Unathi lost her job due to the fight but she’s now starting afresh at a new station, so bury the hatchet.  Let bygones be bygones.

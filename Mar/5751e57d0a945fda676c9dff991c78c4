Former Miss SA Shudufhadzo Musida represented South Africa when the 70th edition of the Miss World pageant took place in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico on Thursday morning (South African time). Karolina Bielawska from Poland became the last beauty standing and was crowned Miss World 2021 pageant winner. Shree Saini from the US was chosen as the first runner-up while Olivia Yace from Cote d’Ivore was picked as the second runner-up. It was Musida’s second attempt at the Miss World pageant, which was first billed to take place in December 2021 but was postponed due to Covid-19 concerns. In January, she made South Africa proud when her name came up in the top 40 of the contest. But she failed to make the cut in this morning’s final stage of the contest at the Coca-Cola Music Hall in San Juan. However, South Africans are proud that Musida had carried the hopes of the nation and represented the country brilliantly.  x  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

There is no evidence that recent cases of typhoid fever are linked to contaminated municipal water in any part of the country, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) said on Monday. “There is also no evidence that the bacteria that causes typhoid fever had been identified in municipal water sources anywhere in the country,” it said. The NICD added that although cases had been confirmed in Gauteng, Western Cape and the North West, contamination of municipal water is extremely unlikely to be the source of infection in any of these clusters. “Typhoid is transmitted from person to person through the fecal-oral route where an infected or asymptomatic individual (who does not exhibit symptoms) with poor hand or body hygiene passes the infection to another person when handling food and water.'”  NICD detects typhoid outbreak in South Africa Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

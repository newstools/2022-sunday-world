 What advice would you give to someone starting a business? Be that child you used to be! If you think your idea will make life easier for potential customers, then focus on that. Customer loyalty is profitability. And get a team of people around you and make sure they can evolve your idea and your business in different ways. What challenges do entrepreneurs face? I think one of the challenges is thinking you need capital before you get a customer. For me, it’s always worked to build relationships with my customers to develop a loyal customer base. Another challenge is making sure you have proper business processes in place, so your business works even when you are not there. What are the qualities of a good entrepreneur? I think one of the most important qualities that good business owners have is understanding their role as a leader in the broader context of society, which I call a “Mayor Mindset.” What free online resources are available to me to help grow my business? From a learning perspective, Google is everyone’s friend and you can get all types of creative content but it’s just so unstructured. I think the British Council’s Creative Economy E-Learning programme is the kind of structured course that creatives can follow, and it’s put together by people with years of experience!

All of my failures happen when I don’t consult someone. My number one rule is to always have people around you. Get a business advisor, lawyer, accountant, mentors, leadership coach, company ambassador and a promoter – these people will help your business stay productive. What mistakes do you see new entrepreneurs making? I think some people who are new to the journey of owning a business think you can write success in a business plan. But there’s a difference between a business plan and planning a business. So don’t get stuck into curating what success will look like because once you get out in the world, it is a tough one.

Johannesburg – Former lightweight and super-middleweight world champion Dingaan “The Rose of Soweto” Thobela has given the rapidly growing celebrity boxing bouts the thumbs-up. Thobela, the darling of the SA boxing fraternity in the early 1990s, was known for his fearless and ruthlessness in which he took on opponents and won world titles. He is regarded as one of the best boxers South Africa has ever produced and is still revered for his epic fights with hard-hitters of the time such as Mauricio Aceves, Orzubek Nazarov, and Tony “The Tiger” Lopez. “The route of celebrity boxing can assist us in getting numbers up and keeping the sport afloat. “A proposal that I am going to put forward is that such fights must be used to support real boxing bouts, and not become the main fights. Celebrity fights can be used to market the game, it’s one of the routes to take to revive the game. It has been happening all over the world,” Thobela said.

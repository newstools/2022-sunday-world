Johannesburg – Former minister of finance Tito Mboweni has resigned from parliament, almost six months after he was removed from the national executive in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s past cabinet reshuffle. In his political career, Mboweni served as the eighth Governor of the South African Reserve Bank (SARS) and the first Black South African to hold the post. He was sworn in as Minister of Finance in October 2018, following Nhlanhla Nene’s resignation. Mboweni submitted his resignation letter bidding farewell to the public office as an African National Congress Member of the National Assembly on Monday. Hours after the close of his political career was confirmed, Mboweni has been appointed as chairman and independent non-executive director of Accelerate, a property fund company.

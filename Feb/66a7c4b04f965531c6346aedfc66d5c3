Actor Sithembiso “SK” Khoza and media personality Moshe Ndiki have sparked dating rumours after a live Instagram video went viral. In the video, SK can be heard saying that people should not hate but rather appreciate. “Maybe I’m a toe guy you never know, my girl got some really nice toes,” he says. Thereafter, the video shows ladies’ pink-painted toenails and then Moshe’s face shows up. Moshe can also be seen busy working his mouth on SK’s torso.  In another video, SK and Moshe are seen looking cozy at the back of a car, singing and having some innocent fun.  Fans quickly reacted to rumours that SK and Moshe, former actors on The Queen, are dating.        For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

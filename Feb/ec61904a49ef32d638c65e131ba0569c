Johannesburg- Viewers of the reality television show, Real Housewives of Durban (RHOD) have expressed that they have had enough of the well-known KwaZulu-Natal polygamist, Musa Mseleku. This comes after his third wife, Thobile Khumalo, made her debut on the show last week and her husband, Mseleku was there in support of his wife. The businessman, who also stars in their family’s reality TV show, Uthando Nesthembu, with all his four wives, has gotten on the last nerve of the RHOD viewers. RHOD’s staunch fans expressed their views on social media, saying they are irked by the polygamy chat every time Mseleku appears on the show which is about housewives living lavish lives.

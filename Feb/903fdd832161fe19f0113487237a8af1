Johannesburg- There’s nothing as frustrating as going to a government department, police station, hospital or municipality – or any of the many spaces for interacting with public officials to access basic services or documents. It is often in these spaces that we are reminded that we are not at the centre of service delivery. Without taking away from the many public servants who do their jobs with diligence and humility, it is important that we talk about those who abuse their position of power behind public service desks. Power here does not only refer to seniority, but the many dynamics at play when a member of the public is at the mercy of the conduct of a public official while trying to access public services. Whether you are trying to renew a licence, certify documents, enquire about a municipal bill that is in a shambles, report a case to the police, apply or renew a passport, you are at the behest of the official who is entrusted with providing that service.

Unathi Nkayi’s secret is out. The veteran media personality will make her return to radio as the host of the All Star Drive on STAR91.9FM. Nkayi, the former Idols SA judge, said excitedly: “I am looking forward to a new and fresh format of radio that I have never attempted before. “To be able to speak to my community, from my community, and for my community is priceless. Being able to speak to a multicultural community is also something that I’m truly excited about because that’s the heart of radio, the heart of Joburg.” The platform is a youth-driven community-based radio station broadcasting from the north of Johannesburg. Station manager Caren du Preez said she was honoured to welcome the former Metro FM and Kaya FM presenter to the station. “I have worked with Unathi in the past and I’m honoured to give this star the platform she deserves to shine brighter than ever,” said Du Preez. “Listeners will get to hear her in a way they’ve never experienced before; free, liberated, motivated, focused and unlimited.” Nkayi makes her debut on the station at the start of next month and will be joined by Justin Toerien between 3pm and 6pm.

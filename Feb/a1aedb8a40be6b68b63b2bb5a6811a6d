Johannesburg-  Bernad Manito Maebela is the latest good samaritan trying to change the circumstances of young girls who can’t afford to buy sanitary towels in Tsimanyane Village, in Limpopo, where he was born. The 35-year-old started the Manito Foundation three years ago. Speaking to Sunday World, Maebela said most girls have to miss school when it’s that time of the month and this means they will fall back on their academics. “The aim is to restore dignity to the girl child, no one has to miss school because they are menstruating. I saw a need and decided to bring about change in the village,” said Maebela. He said they donate more than a thousand sanitary pads to two schools in the Tsimanyane Village yearly. “We donate these products in order to improve the standard of living and make sure that learners don’t worry about sanitary towels monthly as they will be freely given to them,” he said. Maebela said the only challenge they face is financial as they do not have any sponsor on board for their campaign. “Sometimes I get help from my community and ask for donations to make this initiative a success,” he added.  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-171394" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-12.26.58-PM-250x250.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="250" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-12.26.58-PM-250x250.jpeg 250w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-12.26.58-PM-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-12.26.58-PM-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-12.26.58-PM-768x769.jpeg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-12.26.58-PM-696x697.jpeg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-12.26.58-PM-1068x1069.jpeg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-12.26.58-PM-420x420.jpeg 420w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-12.26.58-PM.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /> SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

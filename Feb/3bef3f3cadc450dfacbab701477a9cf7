Johannesburg – SuperSport United CEO Stan Matthews has come out with guns blazing to slam speculations linking Thamanqa Gabuza with KwaZulu-Natal-based clubs. Ghanda-Ghanda as Gabuza is affectionately known has been linked with an exit from the club, as it is reported that he was going to join AmaZulu FC, which later it was reported that the striker will join Royal AM. Speaking to the media, Matthews said that there has never been an offer that was presented to the KwaZulu-Natal-based clubs for Gabuza. “No, again, its newspaper talk, [there is] nothing that has come to us, no contact, no discussions. There is nothing happening on the Gabuza front,” he said. “He does have an option but again, it’s something we’ll look at. We want to look at players’ conduct the whole season. “I can’t be making decisions halfway through the season and then I am giving contract extensions when we don’t meet our team goals, we don’t finish in the top four and we don’t advance in the Nedbank Cup,” he further added. “Then unfortunately some people who are expecting contract extensions are not gonna get because we are here to be competitive and this group of players need to be competitive,” Matthews told reporters. The 34-year-old joined Matsatsantsa-a-Pitori in 2019, from Orlando Pirates in 2019 and has been one of the key players under Kaitano Tembo’s wing.

Johannesburg – The process of putting together the hugely popular season 18 of the South African music show, Idols has finally started. Even though it feels like the previous season has just ended, the show has already announced that auditions for this season are open, and hopefuls can send through a 30 seconds clip to audition. “Entry forms will be made available at midnight on Sunday 23 January, so you can only enter then. Use this time to do all your “la-la-la-la”s and “tra-la-la”s to get yourself into peak audition condition,” the show’s social media account stated in writing. The closing date is the 5th of February, so people who are interested to be part of the show, have less than a week to send their auditions through.   Idols season 18 will air, without the presence of Unathi Nkayi and Randall Abrahams as showrunners announced earlier this year that the judges’ contracts would not be renewed. Unathi wrote a letter of gratitude to the show and everyone she has worked with through the years on the show. For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

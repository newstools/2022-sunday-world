Real House Wives of Durban (RHOD) stars Nonkanyiso “LaConco” Conco and Thobile “MaKhumalo” Mseleku seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot, and the viewers are concerned about LaConco constantly throwing shade at MaKhumalo. In last week’s episode, LaConco revealed to the other ladies how she knew MaKhumalo before the show, and that she is friends with MaYeni. LaConco also revealed that she has no relationship with MaKhumalo, saying she should stop being fake. This after MaKhumalo, said LaConco, had ignored her at a particular radio station. As MaKhumalo arrived for the Halloween Party, LaConco started shading her, saying she does not know who she came dressed as. “We honoured her event and we were dressed according to the black-tie theme which she instructed us about, so I don’t really understand who she came dressed as,” she said. In this week’s episode, viewers got a glimpse of former RHOD star Kgomotso Dungane, who was invited by Sorisha to her Halloween Party. LaConco shared that she was not interested sharing a conversation with Dungane. LaConco’s shady comments about MaKhumalo got the viewers of the show concerned.

Johannesburg- Award-Winning actress and businesswoman has shared how she has been taking good care of her mental health. It is no secret that Connie has been through a tough time lately and having to lose her husband Shona Ferguson six months ago must have been tough. The actress is well known for being a gym bunny and is very passionate about taking care of and maintaining her fabulous body. Taking to social media she shared how exercise has had an effect on her mental health and that she has been off anti-depressants for a couple of years now. “Exercise is good for so many different reasons, but the reason I commit even when I don’t feel like it is because of its effect on my mental health!” “It’s been years that I’ve been off antidepressants, and even in the most challenging times, I managed to stay off. Wake up, PRAY, exercise, and go about your day,” she wrote.  A few days ago Connie took to social media to share how much she still loves and misses her husband, although it has been six months since he passed on.

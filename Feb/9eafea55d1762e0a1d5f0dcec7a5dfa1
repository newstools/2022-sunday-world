Singer, actress, and Gold Series ambassador Simphiwe “Simz” Ngema is of the opinion that building an online profile and becoming a respected influencer on social media is not simple. She said with the influencer market projected to grow to an astonishing $16.4-billion (R247-billion) industry, many content creators on platforms like Instagram and TikTok will tell you that it’s tough to find your authentic voice, to motivate people to respond, encourage and to support you. And while we see many content producers raise their hands, we also see many fall. With more than 2-million followers on Instagram alone, Simz is one of the fortunate few to have made a success of her brand using social media. She shared tips for those trying to gain influence: “The online world can be tough, but 90% of the time you should be enjoying yourself and growing from the process. There are lots of hoops to jump and many do’s and don’ts, so take it slow and listen to the feedback you get from your followers. If you’re not learning and growing, then it’s time to reassess,” she said. For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

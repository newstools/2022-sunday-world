Johannesburg – Nestlé South Africa said that although they are recalling a limited number of Kit Kat Milk Chocolates, due to the possibility that they may contain glass pieces, they had not received any complaints or reported injuries. “We are taking this action out of an abundance of caution having discovered the presence of small pieces of glass during our quality and safety checks,” said the company in a statement. They stated that they are currently investigating what went wrong. “Having spotted the problem, we took steps immediately to fix it. We have put in place extra measures to further strengthen our quality and safety checks to make sure it does not happen again.” “The quality and safety of our products are the top priority for our company. We understand that people will be concerned and apologize unreservedly to them.

Johannesburg- Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) mandated by the Statistics Act (Act No. 6 of 1999) will today start collecting data for official statistics and conduct a census. According to Stats SA, what they call a Census night will commence today, where they will count people such as the homeless, those who stay away from their homes, staying at hotels, traveling or in hospitals. Reports say the South African population has been growing at a faster pace than the economy over the past five years and it has created various socio-economic challenges for policymakers. However, Non-Government Organisation (NGO) Iranti, that represents the LGBTQI community feels excluded from the Census 2022. Programmes manager at Iranti, Ntuthuzo Ndzomo, has spoken about the negative impact that this exclusion will have on the LGBTQI persons when it comes to the allocation of state resources.

Johannesburg – The Supreme Court of Appeal has dismissed Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s request to reconsider the decision to dismiss her SARS Investigative Unit report. On 28 January 2022, Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) President Mandisa Maya dismissed Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s application, with costs, stating that there were no special circumstances to reconsider the judgment. Her report on the so-called SARS rogue unit was slammed by the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria in December 2020. In December 2020, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria judges Selby Baqwa, Annali Basson, and Leonie Windell slammed Mkhwebane’s report on the South African Revenue Servies (SARS) rogue unit and said Mkhwebane’s finding that former SARS commissioner Pravin Gordhan had established an illegal unit within the revenue service were baseless, mainly because her conclusion was based on discredited reports, and that it failed at every point.

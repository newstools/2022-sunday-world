Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe’s persistence to grant Shell, a foreign entity owned by the Dutch, English and Welsh, exploration rights on the Wild Coast is rather annoying. Don’t we have local-owned gas and oil exploration organisations that can do the job? Mantashe, we have big entities of our own, like Sasol, that are equally capable to conduct the exploration rather than selling the rights to overseas companies for a song. Resource exploration and extraction must remain the prerogative of our companies, moegoe.

Johannesburg – Marumo Gallants’ coach Dan Malesela has revealed that his side will make necessary measures to outplay struggling Santos currently playing in the third division, ABC Motsepe League. Gallants will go head-to-head with Santos in the Nedbank Cup last 32 on Sunday at Peter Mokaba Stadium. Kick-off for the match is at 3pm. Since he has joined the Limpopo based side, the former Chippa United and TS Galaxy coach has made a positive impact for the club, where he moved them from four points to 19 points before the Premier Soccer League (PSL) went to the Christmas break last year. Speaking ahead of their upcoming clash, Malesela said his charges will not take Santos lightly. “We will treat it like any other match and with utmost respect, I have just got a little bit of an insight as to how Santos plays, they might be different, but we will handle it well and see what happens in the match and make adjustments where is needed,” he said. However, Malesela stated that Santos is a good team, but his side has a distinctive plan and mandate to overpower the Cape Town-based club. “We must take an initiative in our matches, we need to direct from the beginning, but like I said we will see how the match unfolds, and our players will make necessary adjustments as when they are required,” he added. Gallants are in 11th place on the DSTV Premiership standings after 18 matches. For the latest sports news from Sunday World, click here.

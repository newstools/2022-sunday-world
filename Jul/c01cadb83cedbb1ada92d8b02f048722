This past weekend had to be one of the biggest of all in Durban as the Hollywoodbets Durban July made its comeback after a two-year hiatus due to covid-19. Local celebrities, influencers, and the who’s who of fashion and lifestyle headed to Durban for the annual  extravaganza. The event proved to be a huge success as it returned bigger and better than before at the Hollywoodbets Greyville Racecourse. This year, the theme was ‘Show Me The Honey’ which included a play on dripping gold, metallics, bling, and whatever honey means for each individual.

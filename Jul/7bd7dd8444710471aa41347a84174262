No matter how angry Police Minister Bheki Cele was, it was unbecoming of him to get into a slanging match with lobby group Action Society SA leader Ian Cameron at a community engagement meeting in Gugulethu, Cape Town, last week. During his outrageously embarrassing outburst, Cele repeated calling on Cameron to shut up, even going to the extent of calling him a “young man”. The police minister, as part of the country’s security cluster, must understand people’s frustration with the lack of police action in combating crime. Shut up and act, Cele.

If there is one South African celebrity who does not suffer from abantu bazothini syndrome, it has to be Sithembiso “SK” Khoza. SK, you really disappoint Shwa. To think I had a crush on you, right now I’m not too sure, because your actions are always questionable. When Shwa and the rest of Mzansi recover and try to forget what you last trended for, you drop the bombshell. Are you doing these things intentionally or is there black magic involved? SK’s behaviour really puzzles yours in gossip. The whole week I’ve been trying to make sense of why you joined the Only Fans page. I cannot say it is because you do not have a job, or that you have lost all the endorsements … because you’re still on Kings of Joburg. Perhaps you’re living the life of your previous character on The Queen. As a country, I think you owe us an explanation for all the things you have been doing. Please reach out to your brother and family and get the help you need. Shwa thinks you are crying out for help.  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

Sunday World understands that the two lovebirds exchanged vows in front of a magistrate and witnesses. “They did not want to attract  media attention. You know Lebo M likes to pull out all the stops when he does something,” said a source. Lebo M turns 58 next month, while Samuel is in her 40s. The couple lives together at a golf estate in Blair Atholl, Joburg. Samuels started dating her beau after being the president of the Lebo M Foundation. Sunday World has learnt that their big wedding will happen in summer this year. The source says since Lebo M has family and business associates in different parts the world, he decided to make things official  in the magistrate’s court in the meantime. Another source close to Lebo M says he is much calmer with his new wife, and content.  “She is not just a pretty face, there is more to her than meets the eye. “She is business savvy, and works in the corporate [world] as an executive, so they complement each other well.” Lebo M has been married to Ngani-Casara at least twice. The former couple tried to rekindle their romance on Showmax in a 10-part reality show titled Lebo M – Coming Home. He has also been married to Vivica Gibson and actress Nandi Ndlovu.

Following careful consideration of the current state of the Covid-19 in the country, Standard Bank has decided to scrap its mandatory vaccination policy with immediate effect. The group, one of South Africa’s biggest banking institutions, said its decision was made after considering the regulatory developments. It added that it is confident that it has taken the right decision, noting that 95% of its employees are fully vaccinated. The changes mean employees are no longer required to get vaccinated or produce a negative PCR test when going to the office.

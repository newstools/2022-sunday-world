The SA Revenue Service (SARS) will continue to honour virtual appointments in the absence of its striking workers, it said on Thursday, calling on all taxpayers to utilise digital platforms to file tax-related documents. “In the event that a virtual booking is not honoured, please note that the branch will follow up to do the necessary service recovery,” the revenue service said in a statement. SARS commissioner Edward Kieswetter added that thousands of taxpayers have already filed their tax returns using online services.

Last time we had an in-person event, Somizi and Mohale were the “IT” couple and planning their wedding, which crashed in two seconds (somebody should have instituted a commission of inquiry into why a multimillion-rand wedding could flop in two seconds). But remember, Shwa did say we needed closure. Well, the girl sort of did get that closure nyana seeing the two former lovers in the same marquee. Weird but fun for onlookers. I was walking around minding my own business when I spotted Mohale walking with some men who looked like bodyguards. Perhaps the young fellow fears fisting. Phela, this was the first time he was going to be in the same place as Somizi. I hate to be the one to say this, but the suit Mohale wore seemed too similar to the one he wore at his wedding (come out Mohale, did you want to remind your loud-mouth ex what he has been missing out on?) Anyways, Mohale arrived at the marquee that Somizi was hosting, with Somizi’s estranged friend Lasizwe, and I must say the atmosphere was awkward as hell.

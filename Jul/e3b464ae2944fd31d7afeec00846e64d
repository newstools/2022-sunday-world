Tributes continue to pour in for South African poet, author, and anti-apartheid activist Omaruddin “Don” Mattera who died on Monday aged 87. Mattera, who passed away at his home in Protea North, Soweto was laid to rest at  Westpark Cemetery on Monday evening in accordance to Islamic rites. He underwent a medical check-up at the Military One Hospital in Pretoria a few weeks ago and was recovering at home. His death came a day after the burial of another apartheid stalwart, ANC deputy secretary-general Jesse Duarte, who was laid to rest on Sunday also at the Westpark Cemetery. Gauteng premier David Makhura said Mattera would be remembered for his activism and as a man of integrity. “The passing of Dr Don Mattera is another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” said Makhura. “We will remember him as a renowned South African poet, community activist, former journalist, and musician with an enviable life story. He was a man of great reputation.” He added that Mattera was a man of extraordinary intellect and strength against the forces of apartheid. “We share this moment of deep loss with his family, close friends, and comrades. However, we must celebrate his life and the contribution he has made in our national effort towards nation-building and social cohesion through literature.” Also expressing his sadness, President Cyril Ramaphosa said: “As a nation, we are saddened by the loss of Don Mattera’s eloquent, rousing and revolutionary voice for justice. As we observe International Nelson Mandela Day, we remember Bra Don as a patriot, who in the spirit of this commemorative day, did what he could, with what he had, where he was. “May his soul rest in peace as, in his own prose, he sleeps the sleep of freedom.” The EFF commended Mattera for being a “fierce critique of apartheid”. EFF spokesperson Sinawo Thambo said Mattera was a poet whose literature inspired oppressed people while undermining a regime of guns, racism, and hatred. “Don Mattera was the last breed of what can be known as revolutionary journalism because he used his craft to fight against the denigration of African people. During an era where African intellectuals were attacked, arrested, or co-opted to form part of the infamous Stratcom, Don Mattera remained a journalist of the people. “As an adherent of the Black Consciousness Movement, Mattera formed black unions and institutions to advance the agenda of political and economic liberation. Mattera was banned by the Apartheid government between 1973 and 1982 and was under house arrest for over three years,” said Thambo. Thambo added that Mattera would be remembered as a man who loved his country and his people. ActionSA leader Herman Mashaba also extended the party’s sympathies to the family and friends of Mattera. “Mattera’s contribution to literature will be remembered long after his passing. He held an honorary doctorate degree in literature from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and was granted fellowships from America and Sweden,” said Mashaba. “He continued working with the homeless children in Eldorado Park. It must never be forgotten that Mattera was also a freedom fighter. His involvement in the politics of ‘Black Consciousness’ began in the 1970s. He helped to form the Union of Black Journalists and the Congress of South African Writers. “Throughout the course of his life, he wrote poetry, children’s stories, plays, and an autobiography that won him the Steve Biko Prize. As a journalist, he worked for The  Times, The Sowetan, and Mail & Guardian. “He was a notable persuasive orator and was frequently welcome to be a master of service in different capabilities. He resigned from public exhibitions in 2004.” See more tributes below:        Also read: Poet and apartheid activist Don Mattera dies on Mandela Day Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

Eskom announced that the dreaded stage 6 loadshedding would now be reduced to stage 4 until 10pm on Friday. It will then move on to Stage 2 at 10pm until 7am for both Saturday and Sunday, before moving onto stage 4 again on both days. The power utility said this was due to lower than anticipated demand. On Thursday, Eskom said the high level of absenteeism and intimidation of non-striking workers by those affiliated to unions that embarked on an illegal strike last week was still rife and the reason stage 6 had to implemented. Wage negotiations between the unions and the power utility were expected to be concluded on Friday.

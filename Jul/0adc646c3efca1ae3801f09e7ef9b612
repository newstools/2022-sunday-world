Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s suspension was premature, advocate Dali Mpofu said on Monday at the parliament’s Section 194 inquiry into Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. Mpofu, who represents Mkhwebane, told the inquiry that the suspension was biased and added that it was granted by someone “who is presently being investigated by the public protector”. Mpofu argued that the suspension violates the constitution even though the Constitutional Court found that the laws overseeing the impeachment inquiry processes are lawful. According to Mpofu, parliament has a constitutional duty to protect Mkhwebane, saying she should only be removed by two-thirds rather than a simple majority, and suggested that Mkhwebane’s impeachment should be voted on by secret ballot. According to Nazreen Bawa who is leading the evidence into Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office, Mkhwebane is under scrutiny for misconduct in her SA Reserve Bank investigation and her Financial Services Board report, failing to assist farmers affected by the Gupta-linked Estina Dairy scam, and harassing and intimidating her staff. In June, Mkhwebane was suspended President Cyril Ramaphosa. The Presidency declared at the time that Section 194(3) (a) of the constitution provides that the president may suspend Mkhwebane or “any member of the Chapter 9 institution” at any time following the commencement of the National Assembly’s proceedings for their removal.

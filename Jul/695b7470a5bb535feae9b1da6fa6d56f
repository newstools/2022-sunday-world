Afro-pop duo Blaq Diamond have parted ways with record label Ambitious Entertainment, they revealed on Mac G’s Podcast and Chill. Blaq Diamond said the two parties split on a clean slate around December in 2021, adding that their departure from the record label had nothing to do with finances or ill-treatment by the company. “It was time, we have grown now,” said the duo. “It was between sticking [with] the [record] label or choosing growth more than anything. We wanted to tap into the African market, so they felt like, if we tap into the African market, we’re going to lose our people here local.” The duo from Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal, made up of Ndumiso Mdletshe and Sphelele Dunywa, also shared a music video of their new song Ilanga that was shot during the podcast.

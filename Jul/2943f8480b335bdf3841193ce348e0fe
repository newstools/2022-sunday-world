Since taking to Kaya FM airwaves on Friday, newest additions Dineo Ranaka and Solomzi Phenduka, better known as Sol Phenduka, have caused waves on social media. The duo took over the radio station’s breakfast slot, replacing Skhumbuzo “Skhumba” Hlophe and Thomas Msengana who have since been moved to a different time slot. Kaya FM listeners could not stop raving about the duo, saying the show should be called The Chillers Breakfast because of Phenduka. One Twitter user even said he has become Kaya FM’s new listener because of the new hosts, while others mentioned that they will follow Ranaka wherever she goes because of her talent. Meanwhile, on Metro FM, Samuel “DJ Sabby” Mtshali stepped in to plug the gap left open when Ranaka resigned from the station in June.

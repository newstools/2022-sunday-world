Khanyisile Mahlangu, the reigning Miss Teenager South Africa, is an advocate for overall youth wellness, nutrition and fitness. “This is something I am very passionate about as I was an overweight young child from a family with diabetics. I was taught by my family to make healthy food choices and to be active,” said Mahlangu. The beauty queen shared that the Miss Teenager South Africa organisation is a vessel for her to carry out her advocacy, saying she plans to use the power of her title to teach the youth about the importance of good nutrition and fitness. The 16-year-old added that she is on a mission to get the youth to submit to a healthy lifestyle in order for them to solve a host of physical and mental problems they face daily. “After I lost weight, I became healthier and I was in my best shape. Then I decided that it was time to share this life-changing experience with the youth of South Africa and the world at large,” said Mahlangu, adding that she has always been interested in modeling. Mahlangu will be at the Thick Lifestyle Youth Bootcamp on Saturday at Sandown High School. For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

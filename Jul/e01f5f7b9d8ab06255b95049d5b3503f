Due to [the] industrial action taking place across SARS [branches], we are experiencing delays in servicing our taxpayers,” SARS said in a statement. SARS’ staff first embarked on strike in May when labour and the employer failed to settle on a wage agreement. The revenue service has proposed a 1.39% wage increase that has been rejected by the unions. The following SARS branches and customs offices are closed due to the strike: Gauteng KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape Mpumalanga Eastern Cape Northern Cape and Free State Limpopo For more business news from Sunday World, click here.

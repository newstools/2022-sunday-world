Two Tshwane metro police department officers are in jail after two women filed a case of extortion and harassment against them. Community safety MMC Grandi Theunissen said one of the victims indicated that the officers followed her to her house where she was allegedly forced to accompany them to an ATM to withdraw R3 000. She said the money was later transferred to the officers’ account on discovery that the ATM was not working, according to Theunissen. Tshwane mayor Randall Williams said the money was transferred back to the woman’s account after the arrest of the officers. One of the women is reported to have complained that the residents get intimidated to a point where they have no option but to pay a bribe to officers. “I would like to make it unequivocally clear that the City of Tshwane has a zero-tolerance approach to bribery, corruption or any illegal activities by those within our ranks,” said Theunissen. “Incidents of corruption will be dealt with decisively without fear as we root out those who abuse their power and fail to uphold their oaths of office.” Tshwane has since then initiated internal processes for the suspension of the two officers pending their investigation.

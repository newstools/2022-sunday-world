There are always weird things happening at these events. While we were flabbergasted by Lerato Kganyago being called a Bonang lite, Shwa spotted Boity and Anton Jeftha inside a 22-seater Iveco after the Durban July event. The two looked lost and the boyfriend did say they were getting in the wrong car, but ke Boity insisted they get into the 22-seater. I guess the July will do that to you. You have all the money in the world but get lost in a 22-seater with your soft bae, who can’t stand his ground. It reminded Shwa of the good old high school days, coming back from a matric dance and having to squeeze your gorgeous outfit between people. Perhaps this is how you got into that incident with Bujy; wrong place at the wrong time, and intoxicated. Hope you got to your hotel room safe and sound.

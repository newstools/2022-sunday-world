The City of Tshwane social development and community services department has donated musical instruments to a local arts group. The MMC for social development and community services Peggy de Bruin said when she first met with the Atteridgeville-based Phelindaba Arts and Culture Forum, she was thrilled by the group’s talent. “This is an impressive group of talented people working to serve their communities using art,” said De Bruin. The Phelindaba Arts and Culture Forum is a non-profit organisation that aims to inspire young people to get off the streets and look for artistic ways to express themselves. The group wants to expand its reach to surrounding areas including Saulsville and Lotus Gardens.  “Considering the work and vision of the forum, the city has donated two Casio keyboards and two Johnson acoustic guitars. The donated musical instruments form part of my department’s programme to support and revive the arts and culture sector of Tshwane,” said De Bruin. She added that the work and vision of Phelindaba are aligned with the municipality’s vision, which is the reason the department has chosen to support the group. “I strongly believe that Tshwane has many talented young people who do not have the opportunity to express themselves, and it is my intention to ensure that we offer some form of support to deserving arts groups and forums.” For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

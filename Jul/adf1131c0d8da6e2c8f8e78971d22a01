Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated on Friday, according to international media reports. The reports said Abe was shot in the City of Nara and added that a person of interest has been arrested. This in a country where gun violence is said to be rare. The New York Times said he had sustained two small wounds to the neck, and the bullet traveled to his heart. The doctors failed to resuscitate him after they stopped the bleeding and performed a blood transfusion. Aged 67 at the time of his death, Abe was the longest-serving prime minister when he stepped down from his position in 2020. To read more political news and views, click here.

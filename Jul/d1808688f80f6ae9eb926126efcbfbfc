De Klerk, who won gold in the shot-put and silver in the discus throw at 2021’s junior showpiece in Nairobi, will compete in both events again in Cali. Richardson, who earned 100m silver and led the SA 4x100m relay team to a gold medal and a world record in Nairobi, will turn out in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m events in Cali. The SA team, which includes 25 men and 22 women, features some of the country’s most exciting young prospects in a range of track and field disciplines. Among them are the likes of sprint sensations Viwe Jingqi and Precious Molepo, rising high-jump star Brian Raats and 110m hurdler Emel Keyser. The six-day World U20 Championships will be held at the Estadio Olimpico Pascual Guerrero.

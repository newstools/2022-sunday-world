The fuel price increases have affected South African commuters and car owners who are now toying with the idea of downgrading in a bid to manage the rising cost of living. Himal Parbhoo, CEO of FNB retail cash investments, said the fuel price increases have a negative impact on consumers’ pockets given the current cost of living, noting that people will struggle to manage their finances. “The reality is [that] people need to commute to work, transport their children to school, and run other errands,” said Parbhoo. “During this time, we advise consumers to consider planning their day-to-day or weekly travel, join or start a work lift club and even pack lunch to help in saving any bit of money.” Thabo “Tbo Touch”, who presents Metro FM’s afternoon drive show, has expressed his willingness to trade in his vehicle for an affordable, fuel-efficient car. Molefe turned to his social media platform to express his frustration about the never-ending fuel price increases and the sky-rocketing cost of living. He wrote that he now spends R4 600 a week on petrol costs for one car. “I can’t do it anymore. I’m looking for a KIA Picanto or mazdanyana.”  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

Johannesburg – The African National Congress’s (ANC) 110-year anniversary celebration has gotten off to a rough start. This comes after the Peter Mokaba Memorial Lecture, which was meant to begin at 3:30 pm on Friday afternoon has been delayed. The delay has been caused by some ANC Youth League (ANCYL) members who are protesting at the Jack Botes hall over accreditation issues. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164486" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-07-at-14.30.01.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="909" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-07-at-14.30.01.jpeg 1280w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-07-at-14.30.01-250x178.jpeg 250w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-07-at-14.30.01-800x568.jpeg 800w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-07-at-14.30.01-768x545.jpeg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-07-at-14.30.01-696x494.jpeg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-07-at-14.30.01-1068x758.jpeg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-07-at-14.30.01-591x420.jpeg 591w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-07-at-14.30.01-100x70.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />  ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address the party’s supporters in memory of late ANC Youth League activist Peter Mokaba.

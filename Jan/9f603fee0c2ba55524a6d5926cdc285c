Johannesburg- It seems as if South Africans are not ready to forgive Shimza after he recently posted on Twitter that he needs his helper back soon, as he was running out of socks. Tweeps were not pleased by what he had said and received a lot of criticism for his tweet. On Friday, Shimza was dragged again for his tweet, after a Twitter user said she would be purchasing a car for her helper. Twitter users pulled Shimza into the narrative, saying that he could learn a thing or two from the person who will be blessing her helper with a new car. Take a look at how it unfolded on Twitter below:    The Twitter user @LondonLeeBae shared on social media that she would be buying her helper a car because she had been good to her. “Today I’m going to surprise my Helper. She been good to me since day one,” she wrote.  Tweeps were pleased by what the Twitter user had shared and then one user said Shimza could learn a thing or two about what she had done. “I am sure @Shimza01 will learn a thing or two in appreciating those who help you congratulations to your helper she’s for sure the best.”         For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

This comes after Minister of Tourism, Lindiwe Sisulu said the government has done little or nothing for the victims of colonialism. “If we look around, we see a sea of African poverty. Let’s not fool ourselves and one another; the primary motivation for the evils of colonialism was and still is economic. It is an organised crime; the robbery of other people’s land and resources, as well as the exploitation and despiteful use of their labour,’ she said in an article published on Independent Online (IOL) on the 7th of January 2022.

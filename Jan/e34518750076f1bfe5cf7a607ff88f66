Johannesburg – The Blue Bulls are facing a major injury blow in their squad, with news that utility forward Jacques du Plessis and the new recruit Cyle Brink, might take several weeks before they get their feet together in the field of play. Du Plessis, who recently re-joined the Blues, suffered a heel injury, which found him being ruled out for weeks. According to the Director of rugby Jake White, he said du Plessis will miss several matches as he is on an extended period due to injury. “It has now been decided that the player will undergo corrective surgery on his heel, which will keep him sidelined for an undetermined period,” White told the media. “We are at a point, where if you look where we as a team want to be in the next few years, we have to start getting the best out of him,” he further added. Another player who is on the sidelines due to an injury is Brink, who also joined the Vodacom Bulls as he is battling a thigh-muscle injury and no specific time has been set for his return to action. Du Plessis and Brink have been ruled out of today’s encounter against the Lions, and White said they could also miss both matches next month, where Bull will face the Lions in the second-leg and the Sharks.

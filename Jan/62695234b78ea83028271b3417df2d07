Johannesburg- Legendary actor Patrick Shai who allegedly took his own life in the garage at his house in Dobsonville, Soweto will be laid to rest today. Condolences for the thespian actor Patrick Shai continued to pour in during the week. The reasons for his suicide are not known at this stage but the backlash the thespian received from social media after challenging rapper Cassper Nyovest to a boxing match was allegedly too much to bear for the veteran actor. Shai’s memorial service was held earlier this week, at the market theatre where people who worked closely with him paid their last tributes to him. Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa also attended his memorial service, where he spoke highly of the late thespian. “The industry has lost a true thespian, imitator and teacher. What is not lost is the legacy, he may be gone, but the legacy is not lost,” Mthethwa said. Patricks eldest brother, Solly Shai also spoke highly of his late brother. “We appreciate the love you gave to Molefe, you know how stubborn he was but you were always there to support him. You made him a good man, you were always behind him giving him life and support even at his lowest,” he said. Actress Nambitha Mpumlwana said Patrick encouraged her to stand up for herself because he was not afraid to be a target so that they could rise. “He did not seek the spotlight, it followed him. He was my brother, he had this tendency of taking you with when there were opportunities, he was a selfless human being.” His funeral service will be held at the Soweto theatre today at 8 am.

Johannesburg- Four-time Grammy Award winner, American singer, and songwriter who has sold over 3.3 million records in the United States and 10 million worldwide, India Arie has complimented Lloyiso’s singing skills. Arie took to Instagram to share with her followers her latest favorite artists, and South African singer, songwriter, and producer Lloyiso Gijana made it to the list. She said Lloyiso sings with heart and depth so much that it is striking. “Because a lot of people can sing in notes but it’s a more rare thing to see people go to this place when they sing and he goes to this place. I have sent a DM but he hasn’t gotten back to me yet, so, Lloyiso if you see this message reach out,” she said on the video.

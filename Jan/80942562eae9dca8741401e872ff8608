In his YouTube video, Slik Talk compares Maphorisa to amapiano artist Mr. JazziQ and calls him an ugly “simp” and “clown”. “I found DJ Maphorisa crying like a simp. I was like what are you doing? You are DJ Mphorisa. He was saying ‘Oh he took her’. Grow up, man. DJ Maphoisa is a rich simp. He is ugly and rich, you can see that he has been ugly for his whole life and only got girls after high school. Then you have Mr. JazziQ who has been a player for his whole life so he took her and dominated,” Slik Talk says in his video. “He took his girl and put it on his feed. Then what did Maphorisa do? He was like I’m going to unfollow him on Instagram. What type of clown does that? He is a simp,” Slik Talk further said in his video.

Johannesburg – Cassper, seems everyone wants to fight you. The dude doesn’t seem to be scared to take on Anga Makubalo, better known as NaakMusiq, who is much taller and bigger than him. This after beating up Slik Talk. Shwa thinks beating up a clearly unfit Slik Talk, who was only looking for cash to improve the background of his sordid videos, has gotten to Cassper’s head. NaakMusic is no slouch, and you might get hurt Mr. Monate Mpolaye. But can Cassper choose some worthy opponents for a change? We would still like to see his arch-nemesis AKA run circles around him in the ring.  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

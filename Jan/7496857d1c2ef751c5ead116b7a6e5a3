Johannesburg- Real Housewives of Joburg star Christal Kay is said to be wallowing in stress after learning that she would not be returning to the show. The decision not to bring the controversial reality star back was apparently based on her “bad behaviour”. Sunday World reported last year that season three of the show had to be canned after Kay allegedly had a fight with co-stars Gugu Khathi and Brinnette Seopela. A source close to the show told Sunday World that Kay has been a thorn in the side since learning that she was not going to be part of the new season. “Christal has been calling and begging the production for a second chance, but they won’t take her because she started the fight that led to the canning of the show. “Her behaviour was uncalled for, ”  said the source. Another source from MultiChoice said the remorseful Kay has been asking members of production to take her back. Kay confirmed she was taken aback by the decision to exclude her, warning that its ratings will plummet without her. “I was approached by two other production houses to be part of the show mid-year last year, however, now that Sonia Mbele Productions has been awarded the show, I am dropped. Sonia and I never saw eye to eye during filming,” said Kay. “I was continuously bullied and attacked by the other girls during the filming of her show and I must say she always turned a blind eye to this personal torture on me. “I have devoted my life to the show, now I am dropped unfairly. Who gets fired for doing the best job?” Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

Johannesburg- Suspended Western Cape community safety MEC Albert Fritz and the province’s premier, Alan Winde, must face the music for keeping the sexual assault allegations against Fritz hush-hush. Fritz is alleged to have sexually assaulted four employees in his office, with the incidents dating back to last year. Four other officials have also been suspended for their involvement. Gender-based violence has become a scourge and for Winde not to come clean when one of his top leaders in the province is accused of sexually assaulting women really flies in the face of efforts to nip GBV in the bud. Charmza of the week: Siya Kolisi Kudos to Springbok skipper Siya Kolisi for being crowned SA Rugby Player of the Year, and Lusanda Dumke for winning two gongs – the Springbok Women’s Player of the Year and Provincial Women’s Player of the Year. The bold Aphelele Fassi was given the nod as Young Player of the Year for making a successful step up to Test rugby in his two Tests. Kolisi became the first Springboks captain since Jean de Villiers, in 2013, to win the prestigious award. He dedicated his award to his Bok teammates.

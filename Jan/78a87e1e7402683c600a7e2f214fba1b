Johannesburg – An epic battle between champions sits on the horizon, as World’s best tennis players will go head-to-head tomorrow. The Spanish professional tennis player Rafael Nadal will be eager to break a 21st Grand record when he faces World’s number two star, Danill Medvedev in the Australian Open final. On the other hand, the Russian tennis player will be in full swing to become the first man to follow his maiden major crown with his second at the next Grand Slam event, after beating Novak Djokovic in the US Open final. His triumph over the World No. 1 in New York gave Medvedev a renewed sense of confidence, which he has used in Australia, as he will now be facing the World greatest, Nadal. The 11th time champion, Nadal won four sets in his semi final encounter at Rod Laver Arena, when he faced the World’ number seven, Matteo Berrettini to book his slot in the finals. Despite his long term injury and multiple surgeries, this couldn’t hinder the greatest of all time, as he charged clinical scores against the Italian Berrettini, clinching a 6-3; 6-2; 3-6; 6-3 victory in two hours and 55 minutes on Friday. On the other hand, the 13-time tour-level titlist, Medvedev defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets, marking it his 13 grand slam victory in a row following his US Open triumph. Tomorrow, the final will be the second time the Medvedev has faced the Spaniard in the championship match of a Grand Slam, after losing to him in a five-set thriller in 2019 during the US Open. Since the two have faced each other previously, Nadal has won three times, while Medvedev has only secured one victory. The 2022 Australian Open men’s final will kick-off at 10:30 am.

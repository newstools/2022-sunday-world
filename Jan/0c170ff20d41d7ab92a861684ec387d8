Johannesburg- Mthunzi Ndimande(28) an Afro Pop artist who is well known for his hit album Selimathunzi, recently released a single titled Baningi featuring Mlindo The Vocalist. The Hammersdale born musician has superb vocals and is praised for his outstanding sounds. Mthunzi is not only a singer but is also a brilliant songwriter, producer, and self-taught instrumentalist. Mthunzi’s great passion for music started at a tender age and his mother would ask him to sing in front of his peers. Fast forward to today he acknowledges that his mother discovered his musical talent and significantly contributed to his outcome. Speaking to Sunday World Mthunzi let us in on his plans for 2022 and told us more on his newest single Baningi. “In the African culture witchcraft is associated with using muti on other people so they don’t succeed in whatever they do, but little do we know that witchcraft is also having negative thoughts about someone and not wishing them well.” “When I came up with Baningi I was taking it back to the African culture but it’s basically about the daily struggles that we go through as people, of others not wishing us well in whatever we do. If you carefully watch the music video you will see the message that I tried to portray through the visuals,” he said.  When asked why he decided to feature Mlindo The Vocalist on his single he shared that he did not have a clue that he would be featured. “I was told that Mlindo had listened to the song, what I had done with it and he loved it, Next thing he also added what he wanted to add and we cooked something good and meaningful.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-168621 size-full" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-25-at-11.02.29-AM-1-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="1066" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-25-at-11.02.29-AM-1-1.jpeg 1600w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-25-at-11.02.29-AM-1-1-250x167.jpeg 250w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-25-at-11.02.29-AM-1-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-25-at-11.02.29-AM-1-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-25-at-11.02.29-AM-1-1-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-25-at-11.02.29-AM-1-1-696x464.jpeg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-25-at-11.02.29-AM-1-1-1068x712.jpeg 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-25-at-11.02.29-AM-1-1-630x420.jpeg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /> Mthunzi has also been venturing in the hip and happening music genre amapiano, and he has been doing some collaborations with the likes of De Mthuda and Mdoovar just to name a few. “As an artist, you need to be able to gel into any genre after, all music is music.

Johannesburg- South Africa’s energy problems may soon worsen after the national power utility’s application for a price hike on the cost of electricity in the country. South Africans have been victims of loadshedding at the hands of Eskom for many years now and the power utility says that it seeks urgent relief in the form of a price hike. For the past 2 years, load shedding with the Covid-19 pandemic has badly impacted, businesses, work, and school life of citizens in the country. The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) said that Eskom approached the High Court seeking semi-urgent relief for the court to direct Nersa to consider Eskom’s revenue application for the 2022/2023 financial year and for the court to set the timelines for processing the application in terms of the Fourth Multi-Year Price Determination (MYPD4) methodology. On 3 December 2021, the High Court issued a court order directing NERSA to consider
Eskom’s revenue application for the 2022/2023 financial year. Nersa invited stakeholders to comment until 14 January on Eskom’s proposed tariff increases for the country. Eskom has applied for a 20.5% price hike on the cost of electricity which is expected to commence in April 2022. Take a look at how some South Africans reacted to the proposed price hike on Twitter below:      Stakeholders are requested to comment in writing on the Consultation Paper for Eskom’s MYPD5 revenue application.

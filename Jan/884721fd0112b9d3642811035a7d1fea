Johannesburg – The Nigerian forward Odion Ighalo, has been ruled out of Nigerian squad for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) that will take center stage in Cameroon. The latest update was confirmed by the Nigeria Football Federation in an issued statement on Thursday. “Forward Odion Ighalo is no longer expected as a result of issues with his Saudi Arabian club,” the football ruling body said. It is understood that Ighalo was not released by his Saudi Arabia club Al Shabab owing to contractual reasons. The former Manchester United forward will have been set aside for the 33rd edition of the African football showpiece. The Super Eagles had hopes that Ighalo will steer up the central African giants for goals, as they have suffered the loss of Victor Osimhen and Paul Onuachu, who have also been booted out of the tournament with injuries. Nigeria is yet to make an announcement on the replacement for Saudi Arabia’s Al Shabab goal-scoring machine. Before joining the White Lion from Shanghai Shenhua in 2021, the 2019 Afcon top scorer signed a clause that he would not be involved in international duties. Prior to that move, Ighalo had announced his retirement from the Nigeria national team, however, he was recalled by Gernot Rohr as the German moved to solve the Super Eagles. The Super Eagles are drawn in a very hard contest of Group D, with Egypt, Sudan and Guinea Bissau. Augustine Eguavoen’s men will start their first match of the Afcon on January 11, against the Pharaohs at the Roumde Adjia Stadium in Garoua. For the latest sports news from Sunday World, click here.

Johannesburg – Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) Commissioner Teboho Maruping will be returning to work on February 1, 2022, after he was suspended for over a year. Maruping was suspended in 2020 after a report by the Auditor-General (AG) found irregularities with the payment of Covid-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (Covid-19 TERS). “After lengthy investigations by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU), Mr. Maruping was found not to have benefitted from Covid-19 TERS either through corrupt or fraudulent means,” said the Department of Employment and Labour Director-General Thobile Lamati. However, Lamati has also confirmed that a disciplinary hearing found Maruping guilty in relation to the irregular appointment of media houses to market Covid-19 TERS and consequence management has been meted out to him in this regard. “While an acting commissioner has been appointed to lead the Unemployment Insurance Fund, resolving the matter will provide certainty to the fund and its stakeholders”; Lamati said expressing relief after the reinstatement of UIF’s Maruping. “The return of Mr. Maruping will also bring much-needed leadership stability to the UIF and inspire confidence to staff and stakeholders.  I would like to thank Advocate Mzie Yawa, Ms. Marsha Bronkhorst, and Mr. Teboho Thejane for acting as UIF Commissioners and for steering the ship in the midst of implementing COVID – 19 TERS and Workers Affected by unrest relief scheme”, concluded Lamati.

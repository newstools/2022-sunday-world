Johannesburg – Sports minister Nathi Mthethwa has heaped praises upon current Mamelodi Sundowns chairman Tlhopi Motsepe for leading the club’s ladies team through the ranks. Last year, Sundowns Ladies climbed to Africa’s throne, when they were crowned African champions after thrashing the Ghanaians’ Hasacaas Ladies in the 2021 CAF Women Champions League final. Masandawana as major brand, became the second club in the world to win the men’s and women’s Champions league titles after Spanish side Barcelona. Moreover, Sundowns Ladies completed a remarkable season last year in the SAFA National Women’s League, after they walked away with the HollywoodSuperBets Championship. Singing songs of praise, Mthethwa said the son of Patrice Motsepe has done a stellar job to ensure Banyana Ba Style is on track with the men’s team. “Congratulations to the Chairman of Mamelodi Sundowns, Mr Tlhopi Motsepe for ensuring that the Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies team remains as competitive as their male counterpart and continue to fly the South African Flag high,” said Mthethwa. Several sports fans hailed Mthethwa for extending an appreciation tweet to Motsepe, amongst those who reacted to sports minister, included Kaizer Chiefs number one supporter, Sadaam Maake.

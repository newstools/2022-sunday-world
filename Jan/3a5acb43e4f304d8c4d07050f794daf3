Johannesburg – Many parents make the mistake of believing that they have to wait until their children grow older for them to start saving for ever-ballooning education costs. The reality, however, is that the best time to start saving for your child’s school fees and university costs is now. It is crucial to choose an education plan that provides inflation-beating returns in the long term. This means investing in a savings vehicle that provides capital growth over the medium to long term. The more time you have to invest your money, the more time it has to grow. According to Statistics SA data, education fees increased by 4.1% in 2021, compared to 6.4% in 2020. Shafeeka Anthony from JustMoney.co.za said financial instruments like unit trusts, which offer simple and cost-effective access to the share market through a variety of equities and tax-free savings accounts, are options to consider for saving for your child’s education. “It’s never too soon to start saving for your child’s education. Even a small amount put away every month will grow over time as compound interest plays its part “Do your homework and evaluate your options to determine what best suits your family’s financial needs. If you need guidance to ensure your child’s educational expenses are covered, it’s worthwhile enlisting the help of a trusted financial adviser,” says Anthony. Unit trusts and endowments are ideal if you have 10 to 15 years before tertiary education takes place.

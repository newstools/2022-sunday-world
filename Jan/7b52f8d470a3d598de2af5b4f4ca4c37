Johannesburg – The Gabonese Football Federation has confirmed that the Arsenal star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has tested positive for Covid-19, just five days before his side’s African Cup of Nations (Afcon) opener against Comoros on Monday, next week. According to the GFF, is reported that the 32-year-old striker contracted the virus on his arrival to Cameroon, meaning he will now have to self-isolate. The Arsenal striker made headlines last month when he was stripped of the captain’s armband last month for three different disciplinary breaches by boss Mikel Arteta. Aubemeyang’s shocking Covid-19 results will make a huge spanner into Gabon’s hopes for Afcon, who will now be without their star man for the start of the tournament. Aubameyang, team-mate Mario Lemina and assistant coach Yala Anicet all tested positive after taking a lateral flow test and are awaiting the results from a PCR one. Gabon will face off Comoros on Monday, 10 January at 21:00, and their next opponents will be the Black Stars of Ghana on Friday, 14 January. For the latest sports news from Sunday World, click here.

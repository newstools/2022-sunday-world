Johannesburg- Two police officers apparently failed to detect that accused parliament arsonist Zandile Mafe entered the national key point more than 26 hours before allegedly setting fire to a pile of boxes. Incredible. The two policemen on duty in the control room were caught on camera not doing their jobs: one was sleeping while the other had headphones on. An investigation is underway to determine how and why the two police officers failed to detect that a break-in and an illegal entry into the parliament building had taken place. Unbelievable Charmza Despite the national matric pass rate having increased by 0.2 percentage points from the previous year to 76.4%, under the Department of Basic Education (DBE), it still leaves much to be desired. Students, a majority in private and affluent schools, achieved a 98.3% pass rate. Nevertheless, we salute and congratulate DBE’s Class of 2021 for the achievement. They have had to endure two years of learning under strict Covid-19 conditions and protocols. The DBE caters mainly for pupils from poorest areas. Well done!

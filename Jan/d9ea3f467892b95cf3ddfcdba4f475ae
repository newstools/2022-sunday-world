Johannesburg – A virtually hosted business roadshow by the Free State MEC for small business development, tourism and environmental affairs Makalo Mohale was hijacked by explicit adult content from an unknown participant on Tuesday. In space of 15 minutes into the session, Mohale’s briefing was interrupted, and the MEC had to call off the event with immediate effect. The Zoom meeting was meant to unpack the department’s key activities such as the Free State local economic development and transformation bill and progress update on economic sector master plans for the province. Mohale was shocked by the “Zoom-bombing” incident and the briefing had to be whisked away from the Zoom platform to Facebook. “We have been hacked, and we are going to restart the meeting, and the briefing will be live on Facebook, it’s really shocking to what happened to our previous session, while the MEC was addressing,” departmental media liaison Tiisetso Makhele told Sunday World. The department is currently underway with the roadshow on their Facebook page under the Official Destea page. For the latest sports news from Sunday World, click here.

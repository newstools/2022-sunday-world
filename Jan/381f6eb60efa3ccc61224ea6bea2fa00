Johannesburg- Pearl Thusi and Mr Smeg’s much anticipated ‘National Lunch Date’ appears to have been a success. The duo secured products from different brands to make sure the date was proper. Arriving at his date, Mr Smeg came with a large bouquet of flowers for Thusi, who showed so much appreciation. The two seemed to be having a great time together. They finished off their date at KONKA Soweto, alongside 4 female fans who got lucky and won a spot in the VIP section with Thusi and Smeg.

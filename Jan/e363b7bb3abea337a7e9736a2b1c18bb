Johannesburg – Due to apparent non-compliance with Covid-19 regulations, the African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) Lillian Ngoyi Memorial Lecture has been cancelled. ANC party president Cyril Ramaphosa was expected to deliver the Memorial Lecture at the Peter Mokaba region, Lebowakgomo Civic Centre, as part of the ANC 110th birthday celebrations. The president and Limpopo premier Stanley Mathabatha were escorted out of the building where the lecture was taking place. ANCWL says this was the right call.

Johannesburg – Stellenbosch FC have confirmed the signing of the high goal scoring Colombian midfielder, Juan Carlos Ortiz. Last week, the 29-year-old arrived in South Africa to finalise his move to Stellenbosch FC. On Monday this week, the Colombian international who’s skilled in the middle of the park, began with his training session with the Stellies before he penned down a contract with the Cape Town-based club. The talented key player, who’s amongst the tallest players in the world standing at 1.89m, joins the Winelands outfit from Monagas SC. He has contributed immensely during his spell at the Venezuelan-based outfit, where he was the prominent player. Ortiz can play using both legs, as he’s comfortable in playing as the right-winger, left-winger, and the center-forward.  As Stellies are bolstering their squad, the club is eyeing to find their spot in the top three in the DStv Premiership log, where they will stand a chance to feature in either CAF Champions League or CAF Confederation Cup. Stellenbosch FC is currently occupying the third position in the DStv Premiership standings with 29 points after 18 matches. For the latest sports news from Sunday World, click here.

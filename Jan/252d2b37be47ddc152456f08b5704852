Johannesburg- The Zondo Commission has come and gone, and the past four years were a roller coaster of note, providing us with many funny match-ups. Shwa suggests the following characters should consider going for bonding sessions: Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo and Jacob Zuma should go out for tea and make-up. And were you ever friends? Yakhe Kwinana and Vuyisile Ndzeku should take a trip to the Maldives and sip on all strong drinks before law enforcement agents act on Acting Chief Justice Raymont Zondo’s recommendations. And oh! Did you ever recover your memory, bra Vuyi? Sis Yakhe, how is your daughter’s fat cake business doing? <img class="aligncenter wp-image-164732 size-full" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P20-vuyisile-ndzeku.jpg" alt="" width="886" height="1153" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P20-vuyisile-ndzeku.jpg 886w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P20-vuyisile-ndzeku-192x250.jpg 192w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P20-vuyisile-ndzeku-615x800.jpg 615w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P20-vuyisile-ndzeku-768x999.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P20-vuyisile-ndzeku-696x906.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P20-vuyisile-ndzeku-323x420.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px" /> Somebody should organize a boxing match-up between Vincent Seleka and Matshela Koko. Shwa places her last penny bet on Seleka. Nothing is as creeping as beef between two old men. Tom Moyane and Pravin Gordhan should consider making peace or better still, keep exchanging blows. Age is nothing but a number when it comes to beef. Who remembers Boy Mamabolo’s penguin suit which made him look like he had just stepped off the set of Our Perfect Wedding? We hear he harbors the ambition of being deputy president of the ANC. Have things gotten so bad for the governing party? Imagine the country having a president called Boy. Rest, boy-boy, the governing party is not a kinder garden. Mzwanele Manyi almost had it all, a thriving career as a TV station owner, but he ended up as the condemned. Stop throwing insults at judge Zondo and review the report if you have qualms. Twitter is not an appellate body. It would also be nice to see you having breakfast with the feisty Kate Hofmeyr. Deal?

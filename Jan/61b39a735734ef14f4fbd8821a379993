Johannesburg – Former president Jacob Zuma’s daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, has backed tourism minister Lindiwe Sisulu, in the midst of the political backlash she is receiving over her controversial opinion piece. Zuma-Sambudla’s support for Sisulu follows a video that resurfaced on social media showing the minister praising SA’s constitution at the UN in 2018. During her address, as shown in the clip, Sisulu spoke about the expropriation of land without compensation and further praised the South African constitution saying it is a “democratic instrument”. “Our constitution is a democratic instrument adopted by parliament. It allows us to expropriate land so that we are able to give land to people who will work on the land “This constitution, which allows and guides us to expropriate land, was in [Nelson] Mandela’s hands and his signature is on it. What we are doing is the democratic responsibility of a democratic government, to make sure that all have access to land so that they have the means to live,” Sisulu said at the time. According to Zuma- Sambudla, Sisulu took shots at the judiciary and legislative framework of the land. On the other hand, Acting chief justice Raymond Zondo condemned the piece, saying it was an insult to the entire judiciary, and suggested that action be taken. Zuma-Sambudla took to Twitter to affirm that she stood by Sisulu.

Johannesburg- Metro FM DJ, Umzali wam’s executive producer, and businesswoman Dineo Ranaka’s name has been trending on Twitter after a promoter alleged that she did not pay her. Felicia Zwane, the lady who says she had promoted Dineo’s make-up brand LuvDr on the 3rd and 4th December 2021, reached out to gossip channels because she wanted to spill on her experience with Ranaka. Zwane shared screenshots of a conversation between her and Dineo, where she was requesting her payment from the radio DJ and the response was that her company is still investigating missing cosmetics from the day Zwane was working with her make-up brand. <img class="alignnone wp-image-163979 size-full" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-002.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="846" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-002.jpg 538w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-002-159x250.jpg 159w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-002-509x800.jpg 509w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-002-267x420.jpg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /> According to the screenhsots shared on social media, Dineo alleged that make-up stock went missing since the day Felicia was on duty, which equates to R3 000. <img class="alignnone wp-image-163977 size-full" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-002.jpg" alt="" width="663" height="824" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-002.jpg 663w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-002-201x250.jpg 201w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-002-644x800.jpg 644w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-002-338x420.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /> Zwane has a following just short of 20 000 on Instagram where she posts a lot of make up  related posts to her 19 700 followers.

Johannesburg- In a piece penned early in February 2021, I painted a picture of an entire country hiking through the valley of the shadow of death. We were then under the grip of the second wave. Covid-19 had just gobbled another life in my family at that time. For each of the Covid-19 deaths visited upon my desolate family, we had to mourn without grieving and weep without wailing. This was at a time when Covid-19 vaccines were unheard of in Mzansi. But while the rest of us were postponing our sorrow until tomorrow, the corrupt couldn’t wait, and they couldn’t care less.

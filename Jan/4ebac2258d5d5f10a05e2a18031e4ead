Johannesburg – Springbok captain Siya Kolisi said he was “honoured and grateful” to win the SA Rugby Player of the Year award for the 2021 season after seeing his name engraved on the prestigious trophy in Durban this week. The loose forward, who led the team with distinction both with his quality of play and leadership skills in a challenging 2021 season in which the team spent most of their time in bio-bubbles and had to endure a two-week quarantine in Australia, also congratulated the other award winners. The winners included Kolisi’s teammates Cheslin Kolbe (wing), who won the Castle Lager Test Try of the Year, and Aphelele Fassi (wing), who was named Young Player of the Year. Kolisi, one of only three players to feature in all 13 Tests last year but the only one to start every international, went head-to-head with his national counterparts Lukhanyo Am, Damian de Allende (both centres), Eben Etzebeth (lock) and Makazole Mapimpi (wing) for the award. “So many players stood up in what was a very difficult year for the team, and if one looks at all the players who were nominated, it could have gone to anyone. So I’m very honoured. “Individual achievements are not something we focus on as a team, but I am really honoured and grateful for this award. This, however, would not have been possible without my teammates and the coaching staff.” The Bok captain also had words of encouragement for Fassi, who scored two tries in his two Test matches in 2021. “He’s been working hard and I walked the same journey as him. He’s in the Springbok mix, he’s learning a lot. I also had to wait my turn, and when I got the opportunity, I took it with both hands.” – sarugby.co.za For the latest sports news from Sunday World, click here.

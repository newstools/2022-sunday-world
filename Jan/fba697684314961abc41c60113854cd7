Johannesburg- With the January open transfer window set to end tomorrow, clubs are rushing to beat the deadline in beefing up their squads for the second half of the season. As reported in Sunday World last week, Mamelodi Sundowns made the biggest signing after they acquired the signature of Teboho Mokoena from neighbours SuperSport United. The Brazilians are also on the verge of welcoming Bolivian international Erwin Saavedra to Chloorkop. Another transfer move that made headlines is that of former Sundowns star Nicholus Lukhubeni and Tumelo Njoti, who signed on the dotted line for Maritzburg United. Stellenbosch FC grabbed the signature of Venezuelan Juan Carlos Ortiz in a move that surprised the soccer fraternity. Kaizer Chiefs are finalising the arrival of AmaZulu midfield workhorse Siyethemba Sithebe. Usuthu on the other hand unveiled Abbubaker Mobara and Manyiek Abraham Majok as their two new signings. In Limpopo, Sekhukhune United have been quietly going about their business and they snapped Zambian international Rodrick Kabwe. Still in Limpopo, Baroka have added Ntiyiso Bombi to their squad as they seek to avoid relegation. Royal AM has released 15 players in order to trim their bulging squad and wage bill.

Johannesburg – Talking of stubborn characters, Shwa read the other day that Hlaudi Motsoeneng said he couldn’t pay back the SABC because he has already chowed the R11-million. Bathong Hlaudi, what did you buy? Shwa demands documentary evidence to show us exactly what you spent this moola on. Let me guess… It’s highly unlikely that you spent it on getting a matric certificate – Shwa would have seen your name among this year’s achievers, surely. But you did tell the Zondo Commission that you are “very educated”. Right? Could it be that you spent some of it on English classes? We hope, because wow! Could you have invested the money in your music career? Such a narcissist you are. Let’s hope this time we get a decent CD sleeve cover as opposed to the original that looked like something out of the bubblegum era. A man of your calibre surely needs a bad-boy wardrobe to match that attitude and confidence. So, did you invest in suits less flashy but more pricey? It would make sense if you want to be taken more seriously. Nothing was as horrid as those wedding pieces you made your everyday look, shining so bright they could be seen from a mile away. We advise also for a trendy leather jacket. Note, I said leather, not pleather, Mr Motsoeneng. It would match so well with a motorcycle, one of those Harley numbers. But my sidekick insists you’re a man more suited for a bicycle, the kiddies kind – they claim it’s how you maintain your slender physique. Shwa should catch some tips.

Johannesburg – Since October 2021, FNB has paid out R13 million to three lucky customers for being vaccinated as part of its campaign to promote wellness among customers. In January, FNB paid out R3 million to the final winner, a 48-year-old FNB account holder from the East Rand in Johannesburg, Gauteng. Lee Bromfield, CEO of FNB Life, says, “We are delighted with the positive response we have received from our customers since the announcement of this campaign late last year.” “We would like to congratulate all the winners and hope that the prize money will help them realise some of their lifelong aspirations. Additionally, we thank all our customers who participated in the campaign and for their efforts in helping our country to minimise the impact of COVID-19 by being vaccinated.” Since October last year, FNB customers have been eligible to win millions by simply verifying their vaccination status on the FNB App. Over 300,000 customers participated in the competition through monthly draws. The prize money included R3 million every month for being an FNB customer, an additional R1 million if the winner is over 60 years of age, and customers who have insurance with FNB Life had a chance to receive an extra R2 million. “Through our life insurance business, we’ve witnessed the impact of COVID-19 on people’s health and livelihoods over the last two years. We firmly believe that all partners in society have a responsibility to continue supporting efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. More significantly, we encourage customers to prioritise adherence to safety protocols for their individual wellness,” concludes Bromfield. For more education news from Sunday World, click here.

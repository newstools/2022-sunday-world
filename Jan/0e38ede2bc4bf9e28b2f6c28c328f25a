Johannesburg – Former Scandal! actress Stephanie Sandows-Ndlovu took to social media to praise her husband Hungani Ndlovu on his latest project with Matrixmen. Stephanie took to social media to write a heartfelt message about how proud she was of Hungani and how she admired that he didn’t give up. “I am so unbelievably proud of you and the work you do together with the @matrixmensa team. Despite criticism & backlash (as though GBV is some kind of competition, the term in & of itself includes men AND women), you push through.” “You courageously have those ‘uncomfortable’ conversations, you continue to shine a light on conversations that are somehow, STILL not being spoken about enough.” “Broken men walking around, ashamed to ask for help because that makes them less of a ‘man’, weak, unattractive… And yet, that is the very reason society stands as it stands.” “I know you’ve wanted to quit many times because it seems like nothing is happening- but continue on; you guys are changing lives, you ARE building better men. And we stand behind you,” she wrote.  MatrixMen was established in August 2012 with the sole purpose to raise awareness about male survivors of sexual abuse.

Johannesburg – The newly-signed dribbling wizard Lifa Hlongwane has spoke vividly about his role with TS Galaxy and vowed to leave a mark at the Mpumalanga based-outfit. The former Maritzburg United talisman signed a three-year deal with the Rockets this month and has been training with the club before the Christmas break. The 28-year-old left the team of choice in December last year, following his controversial off-field issues, and with a keen interest in the attacking midfielder, TS Galaxy boss Tim Sukazi obtained the signature of Hlongwane. “It feels good to join TS Galaxy, because I can comprehend their style of play, and I think I am going adjust easily and I am going to have a good season with the team, and I am going to deliver.” When asked about expectations from him since he embarked on this journey, Hlongwane promised to deliver good performance to save the team, as the club is currently occupying 16th position in the log standings. “Looking in their position in the league, I feel the team has been doing well, and I don’t think I will have pressure on my side, I will be assisting the club to climb the ladder,” said Hlongwane. “I think there’s nothing I’m scared of in the ground, I know what I am capable of, and I will like to give a word of a vow to our fans that we will not face relegation, we will stay in the PSL [Premier Soccer League],” said the talented midfielder. Despite Hlongwane, the club also captured the services of former Cape Town City attacking midfielder Shane Roberts. TS Galaxy will play their away game against AmaZulu next month when the DStv Premiership returns to action. For the latest sports news from Sunday World, click here.

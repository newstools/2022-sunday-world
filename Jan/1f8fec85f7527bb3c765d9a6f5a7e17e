Johannesburg – The South African Taxi Association (Sata) has welcomed the news that the country’s license card- printing machine is quarantined in Europe. This meant no traffic officer would fine any driver found without a permit, according to Sata spokesperson Illegal Mageza. “Many of our drivers have battled for months to obtain licenses and we were told by the Department of Transport that the machine contracted a virus and was sent abroad to recuperate,” said Mageza. Transport Minister Sesifikile Mpalooka confirmed to Straight & Two Beers that the machine was shipped to Europe in November after it fell sick. “I can confirm that the only machine we have to print license cards contracted a virulent variant and was sent overseas to be vaccinated,” said Mpalooka. He did not know when the machine would be back.

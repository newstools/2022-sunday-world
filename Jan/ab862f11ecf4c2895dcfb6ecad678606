Johannesburg – Service at the Vereeniging Post Office continued without interruption on 3 January 2022, when the bedding of homeless people behind the building caught fire. In a statement, the South African Post Office confirmed that the building that houses the Vereeniging Post Office was not damaged in any way and the fire was quickly doused. The Post Office will continue to operate normally, and the South African Police have been requested to patrol the building at regular intervals to ensure that homeless people do not stay overnight in the vicinity of the building. “The SA Post Office will ensure that a permanent solution is found to grant access only to employees and customers, such as enclosing the post box lobby and back area with palisade fencing and issuing customers who rent a post box with a key to the post box lobby,” the statement read.

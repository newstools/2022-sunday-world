A 22-year-old man from Bethelsdorp in the Eastern Cape will never again see the light of day after he was sentenced to life in prison for rape, kidnapping, and assault. The accused, who has been in prison since his arrest in July 2018, was found guilty by the regional court in Gqeberha this week. He is said to have taken his victims, aged 22 and 25, respectively to an old caravan in the yard where they had been drinking and raped them. The 22-year-old victim was also assaulted with the firearm. Brigadier Thandiswa Kupiso, acting Nelson Mandela Bay district commissioner, said the violence and the abuse of women must be exposed. Kupiso also encouraged the victims of abuse to report the crimes to the police.

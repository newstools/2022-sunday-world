My fabulous self attended the swanky Real Housewives of Nigeria private screening at the Summer Place. This is one event I can’t fault when it comes to dress code. People respected the theme. Of course, all eyes were on Queen B. To be honest, I was delighted to see Bonang. She made me realize how much the entertainment industry has been boring without her and her never-ending dramas. Queen B made sure all her VIPs went home with a bottle of House of BNG but wait a minute, did Bonang bring her entire staff to work a night shift dishing out House of BNG? Cosatu, can you look into this? B was in the same room as her enemy and former intern social media guru, Phil Mphela, sleek in a black and white suit. Love the new hairdo. Also got to see Babalwa Mneno. She still got the looks, don’t care who says otherwise.    For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

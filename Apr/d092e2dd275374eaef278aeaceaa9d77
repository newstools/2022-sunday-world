The Red on the Rainbow is back in theatres. Directed by Monageng Vice Motshabi, the Standard Bank Young Artist Award winner for theatre 2017, the play was adapted to a short film by Label Noir, which was screened with a reading of sections of the play at the Maxim Gorky Theatre in Berlin in 2020. It first made its South African premier at the Soweto Theatre as part of the Arts Alive Johannesburg International Arts Festival in 2021. The play was then presented at the South African State Theatre, Jika Performing Arts College in Botshabelo, and at the Northern Cape Theatre. It tells the story of the aftermath of the death of a young man on a maize farm at the hands of a farmer’s son and his friends, and explores how time seems to remain frozen. The Red on the Rainbow stars Barileng Thato Malebye, Dambuza Nqumashe, Thapelo Mohapi, Tshireletso Nkoane, and Xolile Gama who are supported by award-winning musicians in Sydney Mavundla and Volley Nchabeleng. The play runs from April 20 to May 1 at the Market Theatre. For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

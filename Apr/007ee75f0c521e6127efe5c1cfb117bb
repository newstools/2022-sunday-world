After being dragged and accused of “bewitching” actor SK Khoza, Izangoma Zodumo reality TV star Gogo Maweni (Lee-Ann Mokopo) has responded to social media bullies. Through her publicist Simphiwe Majola, she said she was not responsible for whatever is happening to Khoza. “All she did was put everything in the hands of her ancestors and God. She said she is not responsible for whatever he [Khoza] is going through and that she got tired chasing after him to maintain his son, so she put everything in God and her ancestor’s hands,” said Majola on behalf of Gogo Maweni. This after Gogo Maweni was dragged into Khoza’s mess after a video surfaced on social media where Khoza could be seen apparently retaliating against a “racist” white man. Gogo Maweni and Khoza share a son. She previously made headlines after taking the actor to court for child maintenance. Few weeks ago, Gogo Maweni shared on social media that she does not have baby-daddy issues, stating that all her baby-daddy issues were sorted out in her indumba (ancestral hut) In her post, Gogo Maweni also stated that if her children do not eat, no one will eat either. Social media users have now dragged her for Khoza’s questionable behaviour. This after a flurry of negative posts regarding her using “muti” that many believe is the cause behind Khoza’s acting out of character.

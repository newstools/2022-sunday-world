While Podcasts is the new trend among radio stations, Y is reverting back to what old school radio stations have are still doing with audio dramas. Their new drama titled Tequila AF was created by Y’s content producer Lumko Johanson. The storyline is one of murder, friendship, loyalty and mental illness. “My late great grandmother introduced me to radio through radio dramas she loved and followed. We didn’t have a TV at the time, I must’ve been four or five and we would gather and listen to the Xhosa stories every night before bed. I trust and believe in this story and commend Y for introducing something so cool to its audience,” said Lumko. It stars rising actors: Andisiwe Mpinda, who is the voice of Sibu, Makoto Phumodi as Pasi, Mmathapelo Bodibe as Pearl, Tshepo Ramasia as Thabiso, and Freddy Mabitsela as Zee. Y’s content manager Phindi Ziqubu said the station was more than a radio offering. After the success of The Banques and Venom Show podcast, they are confident they will be able to produce content for all their platforms. Tequila AF is their second project but first audio drama and they are confident that they will have more offerings. “Our research has shown an undeniable demand amongst younger audiences for this kind of content. Y has been deliberate in ensuring we enter the podcast space with something unique and which is not simply a repurposing of what we produce on-air. Content produced by the station will be available exclusively on the YFM app before it is released on other platforms,” said Hilton Tarrant, Y’s digital manager. Tequila AF will be available from Wednesday, 20 April on the Y app, with new episodes released every Wednesday. For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

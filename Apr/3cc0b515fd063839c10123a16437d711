Big Brother Contestants will be making their return to television screens on Ses’fikile, a brand new late-night talk show on Mzansi Wethu (DStv Channel 163). It will feature seven of the fan’s favourites of the Big Brother Mzansi housemates. Ses’fikile will be hosted by broadcaster, DJ, and currently co-host on South Africa’s popular Podcast and Chill with MacG, Sol Phenduka. Phenduka is also a former housemate. Phenduka will sit down with the housemates in a funny, light setting and nothing is off-limits. They will talk about everything from their journey on the show to the opportunities that have presented themselves since, and what they believe the future holds for them. “We’re excited to have our first original spin-off show that resonates with our audiences and that will no doubt keep our viewers entertained. Our objective is always to find new talent and nurture them as they take a leap into achieving their dreams.  As a channel, we are committed to the growth of our talent and this is one of the many ways we aim to facilitate this,” said Shirley Adonisi, Director of Local Entertainment Channels at M-Net.

If used correctly, credit can add positive value to your financial well-being. But you need to ensure you understand what the total amount is that you will repay, and if that amount is reasonable for the need you want to use the credit for, whether it be for renovating your home or paying for your child’s education. We have all seen the adverts encouraging us to take a loan or buy something with credit because it only costs R250, R500 or R1 000 per month. What does that mean and how much are you paying in total? Let’s look at an example. Say you would like to borrow an amount of R100 000 over a period of five years. The quote that you receive from the financial institution says that you get an interest rate of 15% and the monthly instalment is R2 508.46. This is how the credit provider will calculate your instalment amount: In this example, the interest rate is 15%. All these amounts add up to the total cost that you will pay for the loan over the term. The total amount that you will pay for this loan: R100 000 + R50 507.60 = R150 507.60 (capital amount + interest/fees = total amount payable over the term of the loan).

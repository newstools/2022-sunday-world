Thomas Kgogolo will spend his last day in office on Saturday as the SAA interim CEO before John Lamola takes over the reigns. Kgogolo was appointed to the position in 2021 on an interim basis when the airline exited business rescue. Lamola takes over as the new CEO with effect from May 1.

It added that going forward, it would focus on its transition being led by its majority shareholder, Takatso Consortium, which owns 51% of the airline.

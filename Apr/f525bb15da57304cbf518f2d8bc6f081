Loadshedding will be downgraded to stage two from 10pm on Thursday after generation units at Majuba, Matimba, and Arnot power stations were restored to service. In a statement on Thursday, Eskom said a single unit at Tutuka power station has shut down for repairs after it tripped, noting that this would be repaired within 24 hours. “This, together with the expected lower weekend demand, makes it possible for Eskom to reduce the implementation of loadshedding stage two starting tonight at 22:00,” the power utility said on Thursday. It said power cuts will continue on stage two until Friday evening, promising to adjust the stages depending on the level of the breakdowns at generating units. “Loadshedding is implemented as the last resort to protect the national grid. We therefore request the public to continue using electricity sparingly as we strive to return units to service,” it added.

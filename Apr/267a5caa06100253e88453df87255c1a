South African-born actress and producer Charlize Theron is reaching out to KwaZulu-Natal families affected by the floods that claimed more than 400 lives since Monday last week. Taking to social media on Tuesday, the US-based thespian shared how devastated she is by what had been happening in her home country, noting that her organisation, CTAOP, is hoping to bring immediate support by encouraging people to donate to the fund. She said an easy and accessible way has been created for people who wanted to contribute any amount, adding that 100% of the funds would go directly to the organisation’s branch in KwaZulu-Natal, which would immediately help those in need. She wrote on her social media platform: “My home of South Africa is going through an extraordinarily difficult time, and while I know much of the world is in pain right now, and a lot is being asked of us as global citizens, I’m hoping you’ll find it in your heart to help.”  Also Read: Celebs come together to raise funds for those affected by KZN floods For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

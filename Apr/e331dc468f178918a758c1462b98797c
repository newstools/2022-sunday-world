Late Bafana Bafana defender Anele Ngcongca, who died in a horrific car accident two years ago, is fighting from the grave to force a Jozi man who wrote off his half a million rand car in a prior accident to pay him for damages suffered. The former Mamelodi Sundowns footie, who was released by the Brazilians to play for a KwaZulu-Natal outfit AmaZulu, lost his life on November 23 2020. Ngcongca’s lawyers, HJ Badenhorst & Associates, who are representing his estate, are suing Manala Martin Mathekga for crashing into
Ngcongca’s Mercedes-Benz AMG next to Sundowns headquarters in Chloorkop and Phomolong section in Tembisa on January 27 2019. According to papers filed in the Joburg High Court, the football star was driving when Mathekga skipped a red light and drove into his vehicle. The lawyers said Mathekga drove at an unsafe speed under the circumstances, failed to keep his vehicle under proper control and entered an intersection at an inopportune and dangerous moment. Ngcongca’s attorneys also said after the accident, assessors from MiWay wrote the vehicle off. “As a result, the plaintiff suffered damages in the sum of R440 312.50.” They put the value of the vehicle at R521 350 but after the accident, its value dropped to R100 000. “Notwithstanding due and lawful demand, the defendant has failed and or refused the plaintiff the aforesaid amount, wherefore the plaintiff prays for judgment against the defendant for payment of the sum of R440 031.24.” Attempts to solicit comment from Mathekga drew a blank as he pretended to be someone else when we contacted him.

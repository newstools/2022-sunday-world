The Fabulous Woman Awards, now in its 10th year, will again celebrate and honour women and girls who possess ethical leadership, vision, philanthropy, innovation, excellence, and entrepreneurial drive in August. Founded by award-winning businesswoman and philanthropist Pontsho Manzi, this year’s shindig will be the biggest celebration to date. The awards will bring together women from different sectors and industries to toast those making a difference in their communities. Manzi’s Fabulous Girls Foundation also conducts schools’ outreach workshops in the townships and organises boot camps for maths, as well as science extra lessons. “The foundation offers entrepreneurship training, as well as confidence-building and career guidance workshops. The main purpose of the Fabulous Girls Foundation is to educate and groom young women to contribute positively to society,” said Manzi. “In doing so, the young women are exposed to companies, senior female executives/managers and businesswomen who may provide deserving students with mentorship opportunities and/or bursaries to further their studies in their chosen careers.” The awards are calling for nominations for the following categories: To nominate a fabulous woman worth celebrating, visit the foundation’s website, https://fabulouswomanawards.co.za/categories/ The closing date for nominations is Saturday, April 30.

Social media influencer Michael Bucwa, affectionately known as Mr Smeg, has been told where to get off by American R&B singer Ari Lennox. Ari was reacting to Mr Smeg’s post on social media saying the American singer was beautiful and asked when she would be coming to South Africa. Ari clapped back and said his entire existence was nauseating. She further referred to Mr Smeg “Smegma”, a term many social media users felt was too harsh. Mr Smeg has not been taking the singer’s clapback well, stating that he was not okay and needed a shoulder to cry on.  Ari previously took on an army of MacG’s Podcast and Chill fans after the controversial podcaster asked her an uncomfortable question about her sex life during an interview.

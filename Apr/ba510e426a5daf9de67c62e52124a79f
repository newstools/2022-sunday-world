The DStv Mzansi Viewers Choice Awards nominees were announced during a function at the Polo Room at Inanda Club on Wednesday night. The awards, which recognise and celebrate local talent, are back this year after a two-year pause as a result of the Covid-19 global pandemic. The nominee show was hosted by Lawrence Maleka, who will also take centre stage at the fourth installment of the popular awards show in June. MultiChoice South Africa CEO Nyiko Shiburi said the company prides itself on being at the forefront of storytelling on the continent, sharing that the broadcaster celebrates the greatness of the talent in South Africa. “We are excited to be back on stage and on screen for the 2022 DStv Mzansi Viewers Choice Awards. The nominees are all deserving but the only way to make sure your favourite wins is to vote,” she said. “Through the MyDStv App and on the Mzansi Magic website, you can make your voice heard and guarantee that your star of choice walks away with an award.” The awards have grown in popularity over the years and have become a must-see event on the local calendar. The awards ceremony will be held at Sun Arena in Pretoria on June 25 and will also be broadcast live on Mzansi Magic (DStv channel 161).

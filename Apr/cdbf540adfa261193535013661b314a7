Estranged wife of advocate William Mokhari was on Monday released on R3 000 bail when she appeared at the Alexandra magistrate’s court. Boitumelo Mokhari appeared alongside Shadrack Malipane and Jacob Malope, who were also released on R3 000 bail each following their arrest last week for conspiring to kill Mokhari. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said no conditions were attached to the release of the group. One of the two men is a self-proclaimed Zion Christian Church prophet. The case has been postponed to June 14 for further investigations.

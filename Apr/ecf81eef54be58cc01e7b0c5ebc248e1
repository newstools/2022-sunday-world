Kaizer Chiefs are already beefing up their squad for next season and have agreed on terms with Chippa United bosses to acquire the services of muscular Cameroon-born striker Bienvenu Eva Nga for next season. Chiefs are also on the verge of landing Sipho Mbule from SuperSport United, who is at loggerheads with his club bosses. United boss Stan Matthews made it clear on MetroFM Sport that Mbule is unlikely to play for the team again. “Chiefs want Nga and they have agreed terms with Chippa United. It’s not finalised yet but Chippa are a selling club and this will be finalised at the end of the season. It will be a good deal for all the parties, Chippa, Chiefs and the player,” said an informer close to the events. But the Chilli Boys senior official Morgan Mammila said they do not have any information regarding Nga going to Chiefs. “Those are rumours and we do not comment or give our time to such. In the PSL, if a player scores two goals then he is linked to all the big clubs. “The club will talk about players coming in or those leaving the club at the end of the season,” said Mammila. In January, Mbule’s agent Mike Makaab was quoted saying that Chiefs cannot sign a pre-contract with Amakhosi because SuperSport have an option to extend Mbule’s contract and until they decide against it, he is not free to sign a deal with another club without United agreeing. However, Matthews may end up having to change his mind regarding their stance. “Sipho has been excused from training, his head space is not right. He’s not reliable and we’d rather play without him and finish lower in the league,” Matthews said. “He can’t refuse to sign a contract, Sipho is in a contract. He still has a couple of years left in his contract with SuperSport, so there is no choice about that.”  Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

Reaction officers were called to Ndwedwe after the discovery of the body of a woman. Three other people were presumed to have also drowned in the area, however, their bodies are yet to be recovered. Rusa also received requests from residents in the area to help recover the bodies of three people who were presumed to have drowned in their house. However, Rusa members were unable to gain access to the location due to roads being washed away and the terrain unsuitable for an aircraft to land. The families of 25 people also made contact with the reaction unit to help find their missing loved ones. “Ten people have since made contact with their families. They claimed that they had sought refuge from the downpour and, due to infrastructure damage, were unable to make contact with anyone,” said Rusa. The provincial government expects the number of deaths to rise as the province prepares to begin mop-up operations. https://sundayworld.co.za/news/south-africa/children-among-victims-of-deadly-floods-in-kwazulu-natal/ Teachers and learners trapped in flooded KZN school Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

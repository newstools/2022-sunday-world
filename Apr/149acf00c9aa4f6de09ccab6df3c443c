This week, Muvhango celebrated its 25 anniversary in style and yours in gossip was there to witness it. At some point it felt like a state funeral, that’s how long the speeches and programme were. It didn’t help that there were three programme directors and actress Rami Chuene looked like a chief mourner in a black velvet dress. But I must say short hair suits her. The show’s mastermind, Duma Ka Ndlovu, was happy with how the event turned out. Speakers spoke highly of Ndlovu, which means he is doing something right or they were singing for their supper. Actor Dingaan Khumalo, who was one of the MCs, hinted he drove a convertible when he was starting out (black men and their cars). Not sure why he looks like he is happily married, unless I have missed out on the latest news. Ndlovu opted for a red linen shirt by renowned designer Sonwabile Ndamase, but that made him look like an overweight Chinese supermarket owner. Actor and filmmaker Tony Kgoroge threw jabs at the SABC. For those who do not know, Kgoroge’s big break behind the scenes came from Duma – you see why I’m saying it felt like a funeral at some point?

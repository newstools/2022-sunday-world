In a move to further beef up security measures, the University of Johannesburg(UJ) has implemented blockchain-based certificates for graduates to prevent fraudulent representation of qualifications. The university was the first local institution of higher learning to offer graduates additional value offering of digital certificates a few years ago. This system has not only allowed graduates to securely view and order lost or damaged certificates, but it has also given them access to share certificates securely with third parties or employers at no cost. “The new blockchain-based certificate features will enhance the security of certificates even more,” said Dr Tinus van Zyl, senior director of central academic administration at UJ. “Certificates issued from this year on will have QR codes printed on them, which anybody can scan with a smartphone to verify whether the information on the certificate is correct and has been issued legitimately by UJ. “The public is now able to validate the awarded qualifications for UJ graduates without having to contact the university or having to go through a verification agency just by scanning the QR code on the certificate, and best of all at no cost.” UJ’s registrar professor Kinta Burger said the system would not only protect against fraud, but would also preserve the reputation of the institution. “UJ is committed to applying new technologies to improve systems and service delivery. This continuous improvement strategy and use of cutting-edge technology, facilitated through the 4th Industrial Revolution, are at the heart of our philosophy,” said Burger.

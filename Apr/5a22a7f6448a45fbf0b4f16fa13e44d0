Power utility Eskom held a media briefing on Wednesday where CEO Andre De Ruyter assured that South Africa was far from a total blackout. He said the utility has an unreliable and unpredictable generator system but that teams were working around the clock to end rolling blackouts. He added that the outlook was improving and the power cuts will be reviewed on Thursday as to whether loadshedding can progress to stage 3. He said: “We understand the implication of load shedding for the country and economy. We need more capacity on the grid urgently.” The country is currently on stage 4 of load shedding after the Majuba and Tutuka power stations tripped.

The 2022 Sasol Super League kicks off this weekend countrywide, the SA Football Association (Safa) has announced, saying the women’s football returns for clubs to contest for respective provincial titles. The league comprises 16 teams in each province, with matches played in two streams of eight teams each. A partnership between Sasol and Safa, the league was formed in 2009 to develop women’s football in the country. “We are truly excited about the resumption of the Sasol League, a platform that allows women footballers from all the provinces to show off their capabilities by participating in regular competitive football throughout the year, and to broaden the talent pool for the women’s national teams,” said Nozipho Mbatha, senior manager of group brand and sponsorships at Sasol. The proof is in the pudding as the senior women’s national team and junior national teams have reaped the benefits of the league and have become a force to be reckoned with on the African continent. To date, about 3 800 players have registered to participate in the 2022 Sasol Super League with many of these players displaying their skills and talent while many others will be discovered to represent South Africa in international football. – safa.net Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

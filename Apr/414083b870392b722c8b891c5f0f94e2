Actor Dumisani Dlamini has come under fire once again for being a “fake dad”. In a now deleted post, the Yizo Yizo star congratulated his estranged daughter Doja Cat for winning a Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance alongside singer SZA. Doja Cat won for her hit Kiss Me More last week. “Just wanted to thank everyone who supported my child Zandile, God bless you all,” wrote Dlamini. But social media users, including Lesego Tlhabi, were not impressed, calling him a deadbeat father who just wanted to benefit or to steal her shine. Doja Cat, real name Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini, has never had a relationship with her father, and has been vocal about it. She had told this to veteran US actress Whoopi Goldberg, who worked with her father on Sarafina, a Mbongeni Ngema’s musical that wowed fans across the world.

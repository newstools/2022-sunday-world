Former Ukhozi FM’s Sisonke Drive Show host Siyabonga Mhlongo has crossed the floor to sister radio station Metro FM. Mhlongo, who reportedly did not take kind to his removal from the afternoon drive show in March, will join Thami Ngubeni to present the Sacred Space every Sunday morning. Mhlongo, who received a warm welcome from Sacred Space host Thami Ngubeni, starts in his new role at the beginning of May. He replaces gospel sensation and SA Idols winner Khaya Mthethwa. In March, Sunday World reported that Mhlongo did not report for duty at Ukhozi FM shortly after he was informed about his axing from the afternoon drive show.

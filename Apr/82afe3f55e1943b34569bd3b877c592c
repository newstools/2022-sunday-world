Power has finally been restored to all parts of Johannesburg after a blaze ignited in underground tunnels last week. The fire plunged the Johannesburg CBD and surrounding areas into darkness and led to frustration on the roads because the outage affected the functioning of the robots. “While power has been restored, we appeal to customers who may still be off to log calls so we can send the technicians to attend to those,” said City Power. The city’s power utility added that it was still investigating the cause of the fire and hoped to submit a report soon.

Condolences are streaming in following the death of local fashion designer Lebohang “Quiteria” Kekana who passed away on Sunday at his Melville home in Johannesburg after a short battle with cancer. Kekana’s brother Vincente Moeete said the family has asked for privacy to mourn their loved one who was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer that forms in a white blood cell called plasma cell. Kekana leaves behind his son, parents and siblings. The 38-year-old discovered he had cancer after his body experienced trauma because of the stress associated with the negativity following an altercation with Coconut Khelz, he shared in 2021. After the backlash that went on for four days, he collapsed and had a concussion. After going to the doctor when he started developing lumps on his body, Kekana found out that he had cancer. He rose to fame in 2014 when he partnered with his former friend George Malelu to launch Queteria & George. Together they were unstoppable, creating exquisite garments and dressing prominent South Africans. They showcased their creations at several fashion shows including the African Fashion International, Arise Fashion Week in Nigeria, Afrimma Virtual Fashion Show, and the Dakar Fashion Week by Adama Paris. The pair went separate ways in 2019, which resulted in Kekana going solo and starting his fashion label called Quiteria Atelie. Among others like Boity Thul0 and Natasha Thahane, he also dressed American star Beyoncé for the 2018 Global Citizen concert in Johannesburg. The family said the details about the memorial service and funeral would be communicated in due course.       For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

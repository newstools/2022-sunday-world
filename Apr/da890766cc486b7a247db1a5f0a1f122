Media personality Pearl Modiadie has cleared the air and denied that she is dating Andile Ncube, saying she is in a relationship with someone else. “Please also note that I’m merely putting this out as a sign of respect to our families, close friends and to clear this matter,” she wrote on her social media platform. This follows media reports at the weekend that linked Modiadie to a romantic relationship with Ncube, a radio host and TV sports presenter. The “couple” allegedly sparked romance rumours after they had a cozy date at Tasha’s restaurant in Morningside in March. A source close to a weekend publication said the “couple” were still getting to know each other. Modiadie wrote that she is in a relationship with her partner whom she did not mention by name.

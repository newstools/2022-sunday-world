South African rapper A-Reece is not pleased after his performance at the Cotton Fest, held over two days at the weekend in Johannesburg, was cut off 40 minutes after he had taken to the stage. A-Reece, real name Lehlogonolo Ronald Mataboge, was the closing act of the annual show in Newtown when his performance was interrupted. He later recorded a video where he cried foul at the way he was cut off, although he had been notified that his time was up.

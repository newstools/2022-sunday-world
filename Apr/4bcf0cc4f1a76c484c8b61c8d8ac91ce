South Africa is still in shock after news that singer Lira has been hospitalised after suffering a severe stroke. But a stroke can happen to anyone regardless of age. Your weight also doesn’t matter. The best way to help prevent a stroke is to eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and try to avoid smoking and drinking too much alcohol. Also, stress levels need to be significantly reduced. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds, or when there’s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. This rupture or blockage of the blood vessel prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues. A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can reduce brain damage and other complications. Although we may never know if we can have a stroke, it is possible to reduce your risk of having a stroke by making lifestyle changes to avoid problems such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure.

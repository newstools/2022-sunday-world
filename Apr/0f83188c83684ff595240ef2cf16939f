Coach John Maduka has been quietly going about his duties of turning MaMkhize’s football team, Royal AM, into a force to be reckoned with in the PSL and this week he was handsomely rewarded when named the DStv Premiership Coach of the Month for February and March. The Durban-based side is comfortably lying second in the league standings behind Mamelodi Sundowns. Charmza Maduka’s side is also in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals. Good for you, John.

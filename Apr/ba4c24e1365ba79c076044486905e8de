Sbahle Mzizi won big at the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards when she walked away with the KidFluencer award. The 35th Annual Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards were held on Saturday at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California. The hosts for this year’s awards were Miranda Cosgrove and Rob Gronkowski. The awards ceremony was broadcast live or tape-delayed across all of Nickelodeon’s international networks. It was the first Kids Choice Awards ceremony since the 2004 show to have two hosts, and the first ceremony since 2019 to have a live audience following the outbreak of the Covid-19 global pandemic. The annual Nickelodeon awards ceremony celebrates children’s top choices in the entertainment space. This year Onuigbo Adaeze, Masaka Kids Africana, Sassy Taylor Morrison, Sbahle Mzizi, Uncle Vinny, and Witney Ramabulana were all nominated for the Favourite African Kidfluencer award.

Over the last few years, she has honed her broadcasting, her personal brand has gone from strength to strength, and she remains the true embodiment of youth culture. “We are confident that our audience will be just as thrilled about her return as we are,” said Phindi Ziqubu, Y’s content manager. Mdluli said it is time for people to hear what she is really made of. She said: “I am beyond excited to be back at Y. This new show gives me the platform to continue being purposeful and intentional with my love for music, both on radio and on the decks. “I have been working towards an opportunity like this and the time has finally arrived for me to host drive on Y.”   For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

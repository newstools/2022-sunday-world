Different companies have come forward to help those affected by the deadly KwaZulu-Natal floods, which has seen more than 350 fatalities thus far. Standard Bank CEO, Lungisa Fuzile said they have donated R1m to the Gift of The Givers, , a trusted humanitarian NGO that has been at the forefront of aid at this difficult time. “It is with deep regret and sadness that we learn of the extent of the devastation caused by heavy rain and flooding in KZN. The impact of this event on people’s lives will be felt for a long time to come. We mourn the loss of human life and extend our heartfelt condolences to all those family members, friends and colleagues who have lost loved ones,” said Fuzile. He said they were also donating R1 million to their partners at OneFarm Share to ensure food reaches NGOs, supporting flood-impacted communities with emergency food relief. The University of Johannesburg (UJ) has also launched a KZN Flood Relief Fund to assist the rebuilding of the province. Mike Teke, Chair of UJ Council has pledged to donate R100,000, and the Vice-Chancellor and Principal, Professor Tshilidzi Marwala, will be donating R20,000. This will also be given to the Gift of the Givers. The Shoprite Mobile Soup Kitchens are also serving warm meals to alleviate hunger on the ground. The retailer has also redirected its Act For Change Fund till point donation facility to support local organisations assisting with relief efforts on the ground. The group said customers can donate as little as R5 at the till point in any Shoprite, Checkers and Usave Supermarketa nationwide.

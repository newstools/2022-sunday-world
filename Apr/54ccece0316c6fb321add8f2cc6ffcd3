South Africans who are looking forward to the Easter weekend can be assured that loadshedding will not dampen their plans. This after Eskom said on Thursday that rolling blackouts, in place from Monday evening, will be suspended at 5am on Friday. However, the power utility warned that power cuts will return at the start of next week. “Over the past 24 hours, each unit at the Kusile and Kendal power stations collapsed. The Kusile unit has returned to service this morning together with one of the previously delayed Camden power station units,” said Eskom. “Eskom would like to inform the public that any further deterioration in generation capacity may require further loadshedding.” The power utility is urging the public to use electricity sparingly, especially over the long weekend, to assist replenish the emergency generation reserves in anticipation of the coming week.

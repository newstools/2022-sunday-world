The presiding judge in the Senzo Meyiwa murder case, Tshifhiwa Maumela, on Friday postponed the trial to Monday. The issue of time came into play as the state was about to call a witness who would not have had enough time to testify. The first witness will now take the stand on Monday. Accused number three’s legal representative, advocate Malesela Teffo, asked the court that the accused be moved from a maximum prison to a normal cell due to his ill-health. The five accused pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder, robbery, and illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. They were remanded in police custody. Meyiwa was gunned down inside the home of his girlfriend and the mother of his child Kelly Khumalo in Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg in 2014. Earlier on Friday, the National Prosecuting Authority expressed its frustration with constant postponements since the trial started.

Plans for Easter festivities are likely well under way. As South Africans get ready to host Easter brunches for their families and entertain the young ones with an epic egg hunt, one thing is certain – family time could easily become a pricey affair. However, before you swipe your credit card for those last-minute Easter treats, take a moment to think beyond the four-day long weekend. With petrol and diesel prices at an all-time high as a consequence of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it is advisable to plan your Easter travels by carefully looking at the dent your transport and accommodation expenses will have on your finances. I would also advise against using credit cards to pay for anything you can’t pay for with cash. To make the most of your credit card, you should not live under the mirage that you can afford things you can’t. To help South Africans avoid falling into the debt trap this Easter weekend, here are some top tips on saving: This could include getting everyone to pitch in for the brunch, making your own Easter egg baskets, dyeing your own eggs and finally, for the first time, last-minute shopping is your best friend. If you wait until the last minute, even one day before Easter, you might find that you can get a discount as stores prepare to clear stock.

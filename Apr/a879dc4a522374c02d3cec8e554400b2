A group of pupils from Leondale High School in Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg, are in trouble after they were captured on video smoking dagga inside the school premises. The video, which has since gone viral on social media, resulted in MEC for education in Gauteng, Panyaza Lesufi, to spring into action and suspend the pupils. This after growing calls for action from some politicians and concerned parents.   Lesufi visited the school on Friday and held a meeting with school management. He later shared that the pupils will attend a disciplinary hearing on Monday. “The 36 Leondale High School learners captured on video smoking dagga within the school premises have been removed and suspended from the school. Their disciplinary hearing will be held on Monday,” said Lesufi.  For more education news from Sunday World, click here.

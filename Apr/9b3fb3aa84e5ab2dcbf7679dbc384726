The much-anticipated SAMA28 (South African Music Awards) are upon us and RiCA is calling for nominations in the Lifetime and International Achievement award categories. The two categories honour artists who have shown outstanding achievement in the music industry. Last year, PJ Powers, Lebo M, and Joyous Celebration founder Lindelani MKhize were honoured with Lifetime Achievement awards for their impact in the music industry. Jerusalema hitmaker Master KG walked away with the International Achievement award after his song achieved global success. Jerusalema was viewed more than 480-million times on YouTube. RiSA CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi shared: “We are excited to see the calibre of nominations we will receive in these two categories and even more excited to present these awards to music industry practitioners who not only dedicate themselves to honing their skills, but to honing and developing the skills of the musical legends in the making today.” Nominations for the two categories can be submitted together with a motivation letter and supporting documents by Friday, April 29. The recipients will be selected by the RiSA executive committee, but the Lifetime Achievement award recipients are not eligible for entry.

Middle-distance star Caster Semenya made an appearance and dropped out at 6 000m of the 10 000m race at the Athletics South Africa (ASA) Senior Track and Field Championships at the weekend. As planned, after setting the pace for Glenrose Xaba, who is coached by Semenya, went on to win the 25-lap contest in a personal best of 32:31.49, well ahead of silver medallist Cian Oldknow (32:31.49). Sinesipho Dambile delivered a stunning upset on Saturday, storming to an impressive victory on the third and final day. Dambile won 200m gold in 20.55 seconds, with the 20-year-old athlete holding off a challenge from national record holder and pre-race favourite Clarence Munyai in the men’s half-lap final, which was held in cold conditions. Junior athlete Benjamin Richardson secured the bronze medal in 20.83, again flaunting his immense talent. On an emotional day for 400m hurdles specialist Wenda Nel, who made her last appearance at the ASA Senior Championships in her swansong season, she settled for second place. Zeney van der Walt took the top step on the podium, crossing the line in 55.75, with Nel taking the runner-up position in 56.08, as she was denied a 10th SA title. Taylon Bieldt, who faltered at the final hurdle in a tough battle, settled for bronze in 56.78. The men’s long jump final also produced some excitement, with two men clearing the eight-metre mark. Jovan van Vuuren took the win with a leap of 8.04m, with Cheswill Johnson landing just two centimetres short of the gold medal, producing a best effort of 8.02m to grab silver. Distance runner Precious Mashele was also made to work for his victory in the men’s 5 000m final after opening a small gap on training partner Maxime Chaumeton Chaumeton pushed hard in the latter stages of the race in an attempt to close the gap, but he took second place in 13:42.56, with Mashele holding him off to win in 13:39.92. Local favourite Anthony Timoteus did well to take third position in 13:46.74. Among the women, Banele Shabangu won the SA 200m title in 23.92, Prudence Sekgodiso added 800m gold (2:03.31) to the 1 500m title she won the day before, Deline Mpiti took the 400m final (52.82), Jo-Ane van Dyk was victorious in the javelin throw (58.30m), Ischke Senekal won the shot put (16.23m) and Marissa Swanepoel set a personal best (1:44:28) to win the 20km walk title.

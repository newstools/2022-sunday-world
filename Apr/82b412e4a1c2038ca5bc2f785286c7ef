Having successfully implemented the qualifications’ audit in Zululand district municipality, the IFP is now gunning for uThukela, another municipality that the party snatched from the governing ANC. “When we got to the office, we wanted to ensure that officials are in the right positions and that they possess the required qualifications and competencies. The municipality [manager], who has since left the municipality, assured us that a skills audit had been conducted. We begged him to table the report to the council, but he failed to do so,” uThukela mayor Inkosi Ntandoyenkosi Shabalala told Sunday World. He added that the skills audit was important to ensure that the municipality delivered services effectively to its citizens. In Zululand, when the party proposed the idea, it faced a massive pushback from the National Freedom Party and the EFF, who said the party was purging the workers who were not IFP card-carrying members. The forensic probe revealed that several managers were not equipped to be in their positions. Some managers had matric as their highest qualification but were holding top positions. Facing the possibility of expulsion, the implicated managers fell on their sword, resigning quietly.

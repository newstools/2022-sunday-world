I am praying for my fave celebrities … really, I am! On this holy weekend, your fave has decided to be holy, stop gossiping for a day and offer prayers for our celebrities who really need divine intervention. I don’t want to keep my angel waiting, so let us pray: We pray for Minnie Dlamini, formerly Jones, to spend more time at home with her young child. It is too soon to be gallivanting after her divorce. We can tell she is single and available, there is no need to put it out there.   For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

Thando Munku Ntuli stole the show with her colourful print collection at the South Africa Fashion Week 22 held at the Mall of Africa on Thursday night. Ntuli’s brand Munkus competed among four others – Sixx6, Mekay Designs, Czene.24 and Ipikoko. It was not the first time the young designer entered the talent search competition at SA Fashion Week. This time, she was determined to walk away with the top prize. Ntuli, who grew up in Soweto, said the name of her collection was Sisendleleni, meaning “we are on our way”. Each look is named “ME” (me, mina, nna, mna, nne, mine, we) in various South African languages and ends with “We”. Munkus’ luxury brand makes ready-to-wear garments that can be layered up for any occasion. It is youthful and tells a story through the various colours and her self-created prints. “I created all the prints myself and have used prints to represent the paths women have had to walk. All my prints have a sense of an abstract treasure map,” she said. “The prints tell a story on their own, which should represent the individual wearing them.” she added, noting that her garments are rooted in integrity, novelty, and culture so one can identify their humble beginnings.

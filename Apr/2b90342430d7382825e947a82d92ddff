The Department of Home Affairs says most of its offices in the KwaZulu-Natal province are experiencing network problems. This comes as heavy rains in the province have caused damage to communication infrastructure, which Home Affairs uses to provide its services. “Offices in KZN will prioritise death registration and issuance of Temporary IDs. For this purpose, mobile trucks have been deployed to high volume offices in an effort to bring services closer to the people,” the Department of Home Affairs said in a statement. For other services, members of the public are advised not to go to the offices until further notice. “Technicians are attending to the problem to ensure the connectivity problem is resolved. Delays are expected as some roads are still blocked due to floods,” the department said. The department apologises for the inconvenience caused to citizens and clients. – SAnews.gov.za Also read: State of disaster declared in KwaZulu-Natal as death toll climbs KZN floods death toll rises to 306 as mop-up operations begin Floods put a damper on KwaZulu-Natal tourism industry KZN floods claim lives and leave trail of destruction behind Teachers and learners trapped in flooded KZN school Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

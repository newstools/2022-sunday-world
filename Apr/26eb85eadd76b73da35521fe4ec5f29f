The death toll in KwaZulu-Natal has risen to 306, including 17 children, as mop-up operations get under way following floods that hit the province this week. Many other people are still missing. Provincial cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka said on Thursday some municipalities have resumed services including refuse removal and supply of water after week-long disruptions due to torrential rains. The provincial government, in partnership with social partners, has also started offering relief to displace people housed in community halls across the province. Meanwhile, the South African Funeral Practitioners Association in the province is pleading with families of the deceased to delay the burials by at least a week, citing the wet soil as the reason. The association added that its members were also struggling to cope with the increasing number of deaths. Separately, the weather service in Gauteng has warned that more rains are expected over the Easter weekend which can lead to possible flooding. It said the rains could last last until Monday.

Cristiano Ronaldo has apologised to a supporter following an incident that occurred after their 1-0 defeat to Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday, according to manutd.com. The United forward appeared to knock a cellphone from the hand of a spectator while on his way back to the dressing room at full-time. On his way off the pitch, Ronaldo looked like he was limping and was clearly disappointed with the result, as his emotions seemingly got the better of him following a tough afternoon for United. He took to Instagram on Saturday night to apologise for his actions. He wrote: “It’s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing. Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient, and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. “I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair play and sportsmanship.” – manutd.com Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

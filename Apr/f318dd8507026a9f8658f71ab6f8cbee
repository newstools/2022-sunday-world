South African local and hip hop artists have come together to curate an exclusive Spotify playlist to celebrate the launch of the next episode of the Snoop Dogg and G-Star RAW campaign. The exclusive playlist was crafted by local hip hop stars Shane Eagle, YoungstaCPT, and Courtnaé Paul and has been made available to stream from 4 April 2022. In the playlist, the song Say It Witcha Booty, which was released last year in collaboration with Snoop Dogg and G-Star RAW, is featured and is complemented by local artists’ best Snoop Dogg tracks. Shane Eagle said: “I think Snoop is a living legend. Snoop is one of the original architects of Hip-hop, whose image is paired with buttoned-up flannel shirts, freshly braided hair, and baggy jeans.”  Courtnaé Paul is known to drop a few Snoop tracks in her DJ sets and when she was asked about the most classic on her playlist, she said a set cannot be complete without Snoop’s songs.  YoungstaCPT when asked what he thinks of Snoop’s style he said: “If I think of Snoop now he’s more of a famous personality and icon in the entertainment industry and not just a rap legend.”  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

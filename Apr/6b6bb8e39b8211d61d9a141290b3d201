The application for leave to appeal the conviction and sentencing of Walter Sisulu University student Sibongile Mani has been delayed. Mani, who was sentenced to five years in jail for “stealing” money from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) in 2017, appeared briefly at the East London regional court on Monday. Her supporters who turned up in big numbers say Mani did not steal the money, arguing that she only R800 000 of the R14-million that erroneously deposited into her student account. Mani was only entitled to received R1 400 from NSFAS. The National Prosecuting Authority said the delay in getting the proceedings under way was caused by the defence’s late filing of the documents. The state and defence will now only talk about the application for leave to appeal on April 29.

Leondale High School pupils on the east of Johannesburg were caught napping when the police conducted a raid on Thursday and confiscated dangerous weapons, dagga, and cigarettes. This after 36 pupils were suspended a week ago after a video of them smoking dagga within the school premises went viral on social media. Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school after calls for action intensified.

On Thursday, Lesufi showed appreciation and thanked the police for their partnership with the provincial department of basic education. He also congratulated them for the successful raid at the troubled school.  For more education news from Sunday World, click here.

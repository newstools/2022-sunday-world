Today marks a month since Hillary Gardee was found dead. A suspect in her murder, Sipho Mkhatshwa, applied for bail, which was postponed on Friday by the Nelspruit Magistrate court to next Thursday. Mkhatshwa said in his application that he has a four-day old baby and wanted to be a  present father and needed to have the child registered at Home Affairs. His attorney has since withdrawn from the case stating that there was a conflict of interest, which was not revealed. Mkhatshwa, who is believed to have been a City of Ekurhuleni employee, told the court that he lost his job due to his arrest.

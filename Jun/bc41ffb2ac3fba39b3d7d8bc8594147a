Former Orlando Pirates defender Tonic Chabalala has been arrested for fraud and corruption. Sunday World has learnt that Chabalala, who is originally from Giyani in Limpopo, is expected to appear at the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Monday to apply for bail. National Prosecuting Authority South Gauteng spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane confirmed that the former footie is facing charges of fraud and corruption. “We can confirm that a former Orlando Pirates player, whom we cannot name at this stage because he has not yet appeared in court, has been charged with fraud [and] corruption of about R15-million for allegations of fraudulently creating requests for quotes for companies to be awarded tenders by the City of Johannesburg,” said Mjonondwane. Details of Chabalala’s case were still sketchy at the time of publishing. The 43-year-old former Bucs player also played for Royal Zulu and Dynamos FC after leaving Pirates in 2004.

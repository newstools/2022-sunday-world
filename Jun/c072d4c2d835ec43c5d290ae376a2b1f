Sipho Mbatha, fondly known in showbiz as DJ Sgqemeza, returned to Ukhozi FM on Monday morning after the public broadcaster issued a statement in May noting that it had unscheduled three members of the breakfast show. The trio included DJ Sgqemeza, the host of the breakfast show, and two producers of the show. DJ Sgqemeza took to social media on Sunday to share that he would be returning to his morning slot to present Ukhozi’s Vuka Mzansi Breakfast Show.   Last week, the DJ shared that he had a big decision to make before Monday. “Big decision to make before Monday the 20th, not my will but thine will be done,” he wrote. In May, Ukhozi FM management issued a statement saying it regrets to inform the station’s listeners that three members of the breakfast show team had been unscheduled following an internal investigation. The management said at the time that it would not discuss the matter further because it centred around employer-employee relationship governed by the SABC’s policies. To ensure continuity of the show, Siya Mhlongo acted as the stand-in presenter co-hosting the breakfast show with Nonhlanhla ‘Mroza’ Buthelezi.

After a horrific school bus accident on Tuesday, Dale College Boys school in Queenstown, Eastern Cape announced that exams meant to start on Friday have been postponed. The accident resulted in the death of two pupils while 14 are still in hospital. The children were part of the primary school hockey team. Eastern Cape police said they were investigating a case of culpable homicide after the two under-13 first-team hockey players, aged 12 and 13, died at the scene of the accident. It’s alleged that the driver had lost control of the vehicle place on the N2 just outside Qonce (King William’s Town). The driver was also injured. This incident follows the tragic deaths of two pupils, who died a week apart in April. According to a statement released by the school all the grade 10, 11 and 12 exams have been rescheduled until next week. A sport derby has also been postponed. Principal of the institution Garth Shaw said they are calling for prayers of protection for their school. “We would also like to initiate or encourage weekly prayer meetings for various groups including our parents. We are doing this in memory and out of respect for those who have lost loved ones in this time,” said Shaw.  For more education news from Sunday World, click here.

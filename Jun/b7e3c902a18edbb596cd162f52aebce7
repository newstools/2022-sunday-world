The race to the 28th edition of the South African Music Awards (SAMA28) began on Tuesday morning with the nominees’ announcement topped by Zakes Bantwini with seven nominations. The nominations were held at The Garden Venue Boutique Hotel in Roodepoort and the awards will be screened live on SABC1 on July 31. Last week it was announced that Zakes Bantwini had been nominated in the Record of the Year category, but eyes bloomed when he grabbed six more nominations. His album Ghetto King is up for Album of the Year, Male Artist of the Year, Best Dance Album and Best Engineered Album awards. His two songs Imali with Karyendasoul featuring Nana Atta, and Osama with Kasango are also in the running for Best Collaboration award. Amapiano producer DJ Maphorisa topped the nominations announced last week with his name called four times in the Record of the Year category and bagging the Music Video of the Year nominations for his hit song Izolo with Tyler ICU featuring Mpura, Daliwonga and Visca. Msaki and Mobi Dixon are next in the top contenders’ list with four nominations each. TV reality show star and musician Kelly Khumalo is also in the race for Record of the Year with Ngathwala Ngaye featuring Mondli Ngcobo. This time, king of amapiano Kabza De Small only made it to the Record of the Year category with his hit song Abalele with DJ Maphorisa featuring Msaki, and at least two features from Banyana and Adiwele in the same category.

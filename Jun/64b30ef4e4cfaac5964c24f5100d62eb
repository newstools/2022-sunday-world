Controversial television actor Mangaliso Ngema, charged with rape, has been released on R5000 bail after appearing at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Ngema was arrested by Sandton Police Station last week for allegedly raping his sister, who cannot be named for legal reasons. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) South Gauteng spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane confirmed that Ngema was released on bail after being arrested for rape. She said the former Generations actor would appear on August 4 this year, possibly to tender a plea. Ngema was nabbed after his sister alleged that he repeatedly raped her at his Joburg home for at least two years. She said he asked her to move in with him after she had lost her child in a car accident so that she could emotionally heal. It is alleged  that he sexually violated while his wife was out of the country. She has since left his house after opening a case against him and is now hiding in a place of safety. Ngema hogged media headlines about two years ago when Lithapo actress Lorraine Moropa accused him of sexual harassment. She alleged that the thespian would grab his genitals while looking at her backside.

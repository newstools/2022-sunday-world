Winning the race to become ANC chairperson is a great and fulfilling moment, remarked Panyaza Lesufi following his victory at the highly contested Gauteng elective conference. Held at The Lakes Hotel in Benoni, east of Johannesburg at the weekend, the conference wrapped up in the early hours of Monday when the results for the top five provincial executive committee (PEC) positions were announced. Lesufi, the education MEC in Gauteng, crossed swords with Lebohang Maile, the province’s human settlements MEC, for the top position in the PEC. Lesufi received 575 votes against Maile’s 543, a difference of 32 votes. “This is a great and fulfilling moment and I am glad that there was unity regarding the success of this conference,” said Lesufi after the announcement that he is the new party head in the province. Lesufi’s running mate, Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko, was elected deputy chair. She was the deputy secretary in the previous administration. Former TS Records boss-turned-politician Thembinkosi “TK” Nciza was elected as the new secretary, beating Jacob Khawe and Thulani Kunene. Tasneem Motara will be his deputy. Another ally of Lesufi, Morakane Mosupyoe, was elected to be the ruling party’s new treasurer. She defeated Paul Mojapelo by one vote. On Saturday, the ANC confirmed that it had received an urgent court application to interdict the elective conference from going ahead by one of the organisation’s branches in Ekurhuleni. The matter was filed by Jabulani Sithole and it was heard at the Johannesburg High Court on Saturday evening, which later dismissed Sithole’s the application.

Residents of Johannesburg are warned to stock up on water as Rand Water announced there will be a water shutdown from Friday until Saturday. Areas like Riverlea and extensions, Langlaagte, Braamfotein, Ruimsig, Parktown and extensions and parts of Randburg will be affected by the water shutdown. According to Johannesburg Water the shutdown is due to an installation of a new non-return valve on pump set 20 at the Vereeniging Water Treatment Plant. “The duration of the shutdown will be 24 hours and will take approximately 3-5 days for the system to adequately recover after supply has been fully restored,” said the Johannesburg Water department in a statement. The water supply to the Eikenhof Booster Station will be reduced by 50% and that will affect several areas in Johannesburg Water’s area of supply. Waterval 1, 2, Weltevrenden and Roodepoort are among reservoirs that will be affected.

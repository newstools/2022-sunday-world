Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have harshly condemned the political killings that continue to take place in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). On Thursday morning, Umkhanyakude District Chairperson, Mxolisi Buthelezi, was shot dead while travelling to a caucus meeting. The party’s national spokesperson Sinawo Thambo said Buthelezi had just left his home and was in the Ogengele area in Mtubatuba when unknown suspects driving by, shot at his vehicle, killing him instantly. Buthelezi was with another passenger who was shot in the leg. “Not only was Buthelezi the Regional Chairperson of the EFF in Umkhanyakude but he was also a councillor and an executive member under the Umkhanyakude District Municipality. KZN continues to be a bloodbath for political killings and no meaningful intervention has been made by the ruling government,” said Thambo. He further called on the police to act quickly. “We call on SAPS to move quickly and investigate this matter with urgency and leave no stone unturned in trying to find those who were involved in the brutal murder of Fighter Buthelezi,” he added. Buthelezi’s murder follows that of Thembinkosi Lombo, who was gunned down in February in the Greytown CBD. At the time of his death, he was the ANC councillor for Ward 13 in the uMvoti Municipality.

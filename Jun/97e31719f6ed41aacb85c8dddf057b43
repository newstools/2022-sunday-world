The South African Music Awards (SAMA) have partnered up with the international entertainment platform TikTok. As part of this partnership, the music awards show said they had launched an account on TikTok under the handle @thesamas_ where supporters can follow for exciting, entertaining, and engaging content. This comes as a prelude to the announcement of nominees for the public voted categories of SAMA28 namely Record of the Year, Music Video of the Year, and Artist of the Year, taking place on Friday. TikTok Africa Music Operations Manager Yuvir Pillay said: “Our platform has become a channel for music discovery and a launchpad for various artists in South Africa as well as the globe. So, we are honoured to be part of a prestigious event, such as the SAMA, that celebrates the art of music, the artists and the producers. We are happy to be able to bring this celebration to our TikTok community.” Nhlanhla Sibisi the CEO of RiSA said this was a big milestone for the SAMA. “The partnership is frankly overdue as music holds both these brands together. For TikTok music is the backbone of the platform and content creation, and the SAMA honour music excellence, it was a no-brainer that we work together. We encourage fans and friends of the SAMA and supporters of South African music to head over to TikTok and engage with us. We have big plans for this partnership and more announcements will be made in the near future,” said Sibisi. For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

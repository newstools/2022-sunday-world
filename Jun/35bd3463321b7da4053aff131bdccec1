Newly elected ANC regional chairperson Dada Morero was on Wednesday sworn in as councillor and leader of the party caucus in the City of Joburg. Morero was elected earlier in June as the regional chair in a highly contested leadership race. He beat Sibongile Mgcina to be elected to the position. Morero was initially up against the late Mpho Moerane, who sadly died in a car accident a few days before the elective conference. His deputy is Simon Motha from Orange Farm in the south of Johannesburg while Sasabona Manganye is the secretary of the ANC in the region. Manganye previously served as the party’s regional spokesperson. Speaking to Sunday World after being sworn in, Morero said it is all systems go for the party to be effective and efficient. “We are going to be a more effective opposition party in an attempt to reconnect with our people. We are going to strengthen our caucus and bring back [the] glory days of [the] ANC of the people. Our vision is clear, that we need to win the confidence of our people,” said Morero.

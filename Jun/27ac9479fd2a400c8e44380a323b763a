Orlando Pirates Football Club and defender Thulani ‘Tyson’ Hlatshwayo have announced the end of their journey. Hlatshwayo said he has always wanted to make a meaningful contribution and felt his dream had been fulfilled, which has now influenced his decision to part ways with Pirates. “When I came here, I said I wanted a trophy, and we were able to deliver on that mandate. Unfortunately, the second season didn’t work out the way I wanted it to, and this is what has informed my decision to request the Club to grant me my wish of leaving because I still have a lot to give and a lot to offer in the field of play. This is something that I shared with Management,” said Hlatshwayo. He said he would forever be grateful to the Chairman and the Club for granting him this wish, although he now embarks on a new journey filled with so many emotions. The defender also thanked his fans for all their support during his time at the club. The Soweto-born defender joined Pirates in 2020, coming from Bidvest Wits, who were being disbanded at the time. At the time he was seen as a solution to Pirates’ defensive woes and was handed the captaincy from his first match for the team. His performances, however, never matched the billing. He made costly mistakes from which he never seemed to recover and had since been relegated to the stands. “We had some positive talks (with Management) but with everything taken into careful consideration I have decided it’s the right time for me to leave the Club,” added Hlatshwayo. Orlando Pirates family thanked Hlatshwayo for his meaningful contribution, and professionalism during his stay and wished him well in his new chapter.

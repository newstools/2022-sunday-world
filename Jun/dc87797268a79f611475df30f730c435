By starting early, adults can help the youth acquire the knowledge, practical skills, and confidence to make informed future financial decisions. Now is a good a time as any to start with the empowerment process. Grown-ups need to start talking to kids about money, make the money concept tangible and help the youth become financially literate. We compiled an age-by-age guide that offers grown-ups’ (including younger adults) ideas on what to include in their financial youth-based teachings: TODDLERS (2-3 years) PRESCHOOLERS (3-5 years) GRADE SCHOOLERS (6-12 years) TEENAGERS (12-18 years) They can also make use of available programmes, such as “MoneyTime” or “StarSaver”, that can help teach them financial skills. YOUNG ADULTS (18-30 years)  Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

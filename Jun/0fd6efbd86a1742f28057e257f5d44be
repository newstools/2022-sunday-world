Comair, a local carrier operating Kulula and British Airways, announced on Tuesday night that it has voluntarily suspended its flights with immediate effect. Comair said the suspension was indefinite until the carrier is able to raise funding to operate again, adding that it is in business rescue. It further urged passengers of cancelled flights not to go to airports unless they had made alternative arrangements. In March, Comair cancelled flights after the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) indefinitely suspended its operating licence. This after the local carrier failed to convince the CAA that it had fixed safety concerns uncovered by the regulator following an investigation into a string of mishaps.

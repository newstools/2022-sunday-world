Selected Home Affairs offices would operate until 6pm from Thursday, according to the department, which said the move would speed up the application and collection of smart ID cards and passports. Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has approved the extension of two hours from Thursday until July 15. The department said the extension would also meet the anticipated increase in demand for ID and passport services following the closure of public schools on Friday last week. Motsoaledi added that the extension is critical for service delivery and is part of the department’s many strategies to eliminate long queues at its offices around the country. “We will ensure that every client that is inside these selected offices at the time of closing receives services,” said Motsoaledi. The department also encouraged its clients to use the branch appointment booking system to schedule visits to Home Affairs offices.

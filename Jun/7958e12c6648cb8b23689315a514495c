Canadian rapper and singer Aubrey Drake Graham will drop his seventh studio album Honestly, Nevermind, less than a year after he released Certified Lover Boy. The rapper shared the news on Instagram on Thursday, writing that the project’s official cover art mentions Black Coffee as one of the executive producers of the album.  While going through the song list and cover for the new album, Drake also shared a lengthy poetic statement. “I let my humbleness turn to numbness at times letting time go by knowing I got the endurance to catch it another time. I work with every breath in my body cause it’s the work, not air that makes me feel alive.” The rhyming continues (and is acknowledged) in the next line: “That’s some real detrimental shit but that’s that shit my perfectionist mind doesn’t really mind because no one knows what’s on my mind when I go to sleep at 9 and wake up at 5 unless I say it in rhyme,” he wrote. South Africans woke up to the news and shared how much they were proud of Black Coffee for being one of the producers on Drake’s album.

Singer and songwriter Ndivhudzannyi Ralivhona, popularly known as Makhadzi, has shared her joy after walking away with two awards during the DStv Mzansi Viewers’ Choice Awards (DStvMVCA) at the weekend. She took to her social media platform on Monday to thank her fans for her achievements over the years. “I cannot thank my fans enough for this,” wrote Makhadzi, and reminded her supporters that she would be touring the UK in July. “I released a song Magear just so you don’t forget Makhadzi while I am out [of the country on tour in the UK].” She also took fans down memory lane and shared that two years ago, she begged to perform at the prestigious DStvMVCA for free in order to get exposure and recognition. Years later when the awards returned after a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19, she did not expect to win big. The 25-year-old Limpopo-born singer scooped the Favourite Music Artist award and the Favourite Song award on Saturday night.  Earlier this month while being interviewed by one of the country’s commercial radio stations, Makhadzi was surprised with 13 plaques by her team. She later shared a picture of herself sleeping with all 18 of her plaques. Four of her songs have so far reached platinum status, while some have gone double-platinum. Her album African Queen has also reached gold, less than a year after its release.

Masks off! No, not the famous song by Future. It has been announced that the wearing of masks is no longer compulsory. Now these masks have taken us on a roller-coaster ride since we were commanded to wear them when the brutal Covid-19 pandemic hit the country in 2020. Each individual was forced to wear a mask each time they left the house, and at some point you would be chased by soldiers if you were walking around without this facial piece. Those were unfortunate days, as we will remember. Passed too many people on the streets because you didn’t recognise them? Or maybe hit on someone you wouldn’t have if their masks were off. Some people might have even forgotten how to brush their teeth. This was the journey, from sadness to drama and fashion – but some masks were just too much! <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-195360" src="http://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/P21-rich-mask-200x250.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="250" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/P21-rich-mask-200x250.jpg 200w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/P21-rich-mask-639x800.jpg 639w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/P21-rich-mask-696x871.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/P21-rich-mask-336x420.jpg 336w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/P21-rich-mask.jpg 708w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /> As Mzansi would have it, every unfortunate situation is bound to give us something to laugh about. There is just no way we will forget the depressing family meeting that ended with a good laugh as the dear president of the country, Cyril Ramaphosa was trying to teach us how to wear masks but he failed to put it all together. In fact, that remains the highlight – he was probably just thinking about the money in the mattress. Just remembered the camouflage masks that made it look like you are not wearing any, from a distance. It was exhausting to see people wearing these masks, especially the young school kid captured in a video.  If ever it was compulsory to wear masks again, I  hope these particular masks will be banned. The flamboyant Somizi would not allow the compulsory wearing of masks to depress him or ruin his fashion sense. He went from matching the small facial piece to his attire, to wearing fashionable glittered gas masks at the DStv Mzansi Viewers’ Choice Awards. But he was no match for the glamorous Mam’Khize, who rocked up with masks that made a firm fashion statement. Making a trend out of the dire situation was  inspired by local high-end fashion designer Rich Mnisi, who introduced the masks at a retail price of R1 999. Maxhosa followed the trend and introduced his R600 mask. It is time to hang them on the room-divider for decoration, peeps! Generations to come should see that you slayed the novel coronavirus. But it cannot be ignored that the wearing of masks drained the country, even people in governance. Mpumalanga premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane was fined R1 500 for failing to wear a mask in a public space. This was during the funeral of the minister in the presidency Jackson Mthembu. Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, now small business development minister, also felt the harsh backlash for disrespecting lockdown regulations after she was found to have attended a dinner party at Mduduzi Manana’s house when no visits were allowed. She was placed on two months’ special leave after pictures of the dinner party were leaked. Shwa still feels this was not enough. In a heart-breaking incident, a Nedbank branch was nearly robbed by tsotsis who hid their faces behind masks. I mean, there’s so little to see when the nose and mouth are covered. But it’s all over now, and whoever feels able can start mopping the floors with the masks and share beautiful smiles once again. A time to celebrate!

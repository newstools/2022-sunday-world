MultiChoice is launching an incubator programme called Studio Reach, which aims to unlock the next generation of digital video content creators. The company, which owns DStv, a major satellite television service in sub-Saharan Africa, is looking for 10 video content creators between the ages of 18-35 who are familiar with the social media platform TikTok. Those chosen will become part of the MultiChoice Studio Reach Incubator, an online content creation programme. They will learn digital storytelling skills, business skills, connect with other creators, and receive a one-year subsidised internship with MultiChoice brands between June 20 2022 and June 20 2023. The programme will engage young creative digital thinkers to produce digital-first content in line with future thinking and social trends. Group executive for corporate affairs at MultiChoice Collen Dlamini said: “It is our continued commitment to enrich lives, and this programme aims to do just that. We are excited to bring this programme to life and work hand in hand with up-and-coming content creators in honing their skill sets.” Dlamini said there is an abundance of untapped creatives among the nation’s youth, who only need a springboard to showcase their skills. He added that MultiChoice wants to offer a hand-up to help kick-start the careers of 10 young creatives and to give them the opportunity to improve their abilities as digital content creators.

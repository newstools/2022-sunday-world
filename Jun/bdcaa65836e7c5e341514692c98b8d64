A former traffic official, Sello Thomo, has been handed a jail sentence of nine years after being found guilty of fraud and corruption for issuing illegal learners and drivers licenses. Thomo appeared before the Ermelo Magistrate court on Wednesday in Mpumalanga after being arrested by the Hawks’ Mpumalanga in 2017. Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said: “During the time, the accused was employed at Ermelo licencing office and responsible for issuing of learner’s and driver’s licenses. An investigation revealed that the accused person fraudulently issued learners and driving licences to people who were not tested.” Licence holders testified in court that they had paid money to get their licences without being tested. The Provincial Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Major General Zodwa Mokoena, applauded the “phenomenal labour” by the investigation team and judiciary for securing the sentence, especially for a person who was supposed to advise the public about safety on the road by encouraging them to be tested before they receive their licences.

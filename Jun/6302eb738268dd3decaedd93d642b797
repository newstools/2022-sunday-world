The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) is calling for the fuel levy relief of R1.50 to be extended for July as another fuel hike is on the cards. “The fuel levy reprieve of R1.50 per litre has been in place for April, May and June. Should the Minister of Finance Enoch Godongwana reduce this to a reprieve of 75c per litre from 6 July to 2 August, as planned, we can expect a petrol price of around R2.50 in July, thereby pushing the price of 95 octanes inland from R24.17 per litre to around R26.70,” said the organisation. It said the Ukraine war continues to keep the international price of oil between $110 and $120 per barrel. “We believe that while petrol prices remain above R22 per litre, the Minister would be wise to retain the full R1.50 reduction,” said OUTA. OUTA said the price of petrol is expected to increase by an estimated R1.75 in the first week of July. For more business news from Sunday World, click here.

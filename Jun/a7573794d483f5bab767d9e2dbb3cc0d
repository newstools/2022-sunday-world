Maskandi fans around the country will for the first time enjoy their favourite sound at the highly anticipated Durban July at the weekend. The Masiqoqane Durban July Maskandi Festival, which is the brainchild of Masiqoqane Albinism Foundation, will make its debut at this year’s horseracing and fashion event. The event, by the foundation which advocates for the rights of people living with disabilities, will be hosted at Durban Station next to Sassa offices on Saturday. Expected to perform at the festival will be Khuzani Mpungose, Bahubhe, Amageza Amahle, Ithwasa Lekhansela, and Amavikelambuso, among many other maskandi household names. Also billed to feature in the event are veteran radio host Linda Sibiya, Khuzani Mpungose, Dr Bone, Zakwe and Duncan as the organisers go all out to attract nationwide patrons. Event organiser and radio presenter Andile “MC Pholobas” Ngcobo said the Masiqoqane festival aims to raise funds to sustain the foundation’s awareness campaigns. “Masiqoqane always holds its events in July. This year we thought we could do it differently and attract masses because KwaZulu-Natal is the home of maskandi, but there is no maskanda-focused event at the most attractive Durban July,” said Ngcobo. Ngcobo added that the event will also seek to discourage myths that kidnapping and killing people who live with albinism for muthi attracts wealth and power. “The aim is to fight against the killing and abuse of people living with albinism. We hope to raise enough funds and stop the killings. For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

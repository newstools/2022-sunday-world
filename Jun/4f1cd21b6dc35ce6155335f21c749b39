The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has confirmed the country’s second case of monkeypox. In a statement, the NICD said it was a 32-year-old male from the Western Cape with no recent ravel history. Global statistics since May are now more than 4000 cases confirmed in several European countries as well as in the USA, Canada, Australia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. SA’s first case was said to be a 30-year-old male from Johannesburg, Gauteng, who also reported no travel history. “Contact tracing has commenced in order to identify any other related cases of Monkeypox in South Africa. Isolation of confirmed cases allows for the prevention of transmission and interruption of the cycle of transmission. Currently, it is not known if the first and second cases are linked,” the institute said on Tuesday. The World Health Organisation has recommended increasing vigilance for cases with contact tracing and monitoring of laboratory-confirmed cases.

President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to later respond to the allegations levelled against him by the former State Security Agency director-general Arthur Fraser at the Rosebank Police State on Wednesday. According to recently appointed spokesperson Vincent Magwenya, Ramaphosa was only informed of the charges late in the evening on Wednesday after his cabinet meeting. Said Magwenya: “President was chairing a cabinet meeting until late in the evening yesterday. He has been informed about the Arthur Fraser statement. The Presidency will communicate in due course.” The allegations emanate from the alleged theft of over four million US dollars allegedly concealed at Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala farm in Waterberg, Limpopo. According to Fraser, Ramaphosa was in cahoots with “criminals” who were colluding with his domestic workers. Said Fraser in a statement on Wednesday: “The President concealed the crime from the South African Police Service and/or South African Revenue Service (SARS*) and thereafter paid the culprits for their silence. The evidence I provide shows that the said burglary took place on 9 February 2020. This conduct of the President and those involved constitutes a breach of, infer alia, the Prevention of Organized Crime Act, No. 121 of 1998 (POCA*) and the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act No. 12 of 2004 (“the Corruption Act*).” Ramaphosa faces charges including defeating the ends of justice, kidnapping of suspects, and bribery.

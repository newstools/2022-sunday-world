South African rapper Unathi Bhongo Mnyango, known by his stage name Anatii, has removed his solo music from online music streaming platforms. “Time for creators to take control and sell art not your soul. I removed my solo albums from streaming platforms, it’s been good,” he wrote on social media on Monday, explaining his move to fans and supporters. The 29-year-old Iyeza hitmaker’s decision followed the sudden disappearance of the late hip-hop artist Riky Rick’s album Family Values online. Last week, the album was removed due to a licensing deal that is being renewed and will reportedly be uploaded again on all online music platforms.

The distressed family of a six-year-old boy who fell into a manhole in Dlamini, Soweto on Sunday is still hoping to find their child. Speaking to Sunday World on Tuesday, the Emergency Management Services (EMS) spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said the search had resumed and the team is actively searching in all the hotspot areas. “The boy has not been found and the team has started searching for the day. We are searching in all the hotspot areas where we think he can be found,” said Mulaudzi. It has since come to light that the boy was playing with friends when he allegedly jumped on a board covering the manhole. The board broke into pieces and he fell inside. On Monday the family, members of the community, EMS, and the police embarked on search and rescue operations that were called off when it started to get dark. The MMC for environment and infrastructure in the City of Johannesburg, Michael Sun, said he is monitoring the situation.

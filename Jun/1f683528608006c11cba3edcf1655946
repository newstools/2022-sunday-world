A Free State duo is in jail awaiting to apply for bail for possession and dealing in explosives worth R50 000 on the black market. Nine blasting cartridges and five shock tube assemblies were seized when the Hawks’ serious organised crime investigation team based in Welkom, K9 unit based in Kroonstad, and the stock theft unit in Heilbron pounced on the suspects at the weekend. Kelibone Mathobaku, 44, and Joseph Morapeli, 39, had allegedly been looking to sell their illegal loot when they fell into a trap by the officials, who had set in motion the operation following a tip-off. Free State police spokesperson Captain Christopher Singo said the police followed up on the information and made arrangements to meet with the suspects with an intention to buy the explosives. “The suspects then agreed to meet the police [who disguised as buyers] where they offered to sell the explosives for an amount of R50 000. During the meeting, they then reduced the offer to R35 000,” said Singo. “After they agreed on the offer, the suspects produced the explosives and the [disguised] police official alerted other members of the police who came and arrested the suspects.” The suspects appeared at the Heilbron magistrate’s court on Monday and the case was adjourned to June 20 for a formal bail application.

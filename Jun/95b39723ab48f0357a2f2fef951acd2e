On Saturday, I also braved more miserable weather. I decided to take my sidekick and go all the way downtown to witness the power of the arts. The highly anticipated Baseline Festival attracted lots of hot people. It’s a pity many of them came with their plus one’s making it difficult for us to mingle. This is what I hate about grooving in winter – people come with their partners so they don’t sleep alone at night. Back to the show, everything was beautiful. The performances were out of this world. Nakhane was a class act; you can tell the girl is friends with Madonna.  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

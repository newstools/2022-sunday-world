Musician Zandie Khumalo-Gumede, who is the sister of Kelly Khumalo, has caused a stir on social media after she posted lyrics to her latest single Ikhwela. Zandie and Kelly had a rather public tiff via social media with posts directed at each other. Kelly issued a statement that the was divorcing her sister. The lyrics caused a stir after Advocate Teffo in the Senzo Meyiwa trial dropped a bomb in court on Wednesday, stating that an witness would testify that Kelly allegedly shot Senzo accidentally. The lyrics are: “Sengihambe ibanga elide,angisaphindeli emuva mina ngizondwa abantu abaningi ngakini namabhungu angakini angithwesa inganono.” “I have travelled a long journey I’m no longer going back I’m even hated by a lot of people. The time has come for me to blow a whistle, what do you say? There’s no day that never comes,” she wrote. South Africans are now questioning the cryptic lyrics, wondering if she could be the “mysterious” witness.
